The list contains a unique endpoint for every storage space. Storage space registries manage the list of storage spaces a user has access to. They may subscribe to storage spaces in order to receive notifications about changes on behalf of an end users mobile or desktop client. Storage spaces represent a collection of files and folders. A users personal files are contained in a storage space, a group or project drive is a storage space, and even incoming shares are treated and implemented as storage spaces. Each with properties like owners, permissions, quota and type. Storage providers can hold multiple storage spaces. At an oCIS instance, there might be a dedicated storage provider responsible for users personal storage spaces. There might be multiple, either to shard the load, provide different levels of redundancy or support custom workflows. Or there might be just one, hosting all types of storage spaces. As an example, Einstein might want to share something with Marie, who has an account at a different identity provider and uses a different storage space registry. The process makes use of OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and would look something like this:\nTo share something with Marie, Einstein would open https://cloud.zurich.test. His browser loads oCIS web and presents a login form that uses the OpenID Connect Discovery to look up the OIDC issuer. For einstein@zurich.test he will end up at https://idp.zurich.test, authenticate and get redirected back to https://cloud.zurich.test. Now, oCIS web will use a similar discovery to look up the storage space registry for the account, based on the email (or username). He will discover that https://cloud.zurich.test is also his storage registry that the web UI will use to load the list of storage spaces that are available to him.\nAfter locating a folder that he wants to share with Marie he enters her email marie@paris.test in the sharing dialog to grant her the editor role. This, in effect, creates a new storage space that is registered with the storage space registry at https://cloud.zurich.test.\nEinstein copies the URL in the browser (or an email with the same URL is sent automatically, or the storage registries use a back-channel mechanism). It contains the most specific storage space id and a path relative to it: https://cloud.zurich.test/#/spaces/716199a6-00c0-4fec-93d2-7e00150b1c84/a/rel/path.\nWhen Marie enters that URL she will be presented with a login form on the https://cloud.zurich.test instance, because the share was created on that domain. If https://cloud.zurich.test trusts her OpenID Connect identity provider https://idp.paris.test she can log in. This time, the storage space registry discovery will come up with https://cloud.paris.test though. Since that registry is different than the registry tied to https://cloud.zurich.test oCIS web can look up the storage space 716199a6-00c0-4fec-93d2-7e00150b1c84 and register the WebDAV URL https://cloud.zurich.test/dav/spaces/716199a6-00c0-4fec-93d2-7e00150b1c84/a/rel/path in Marie\u0026rsquo;s storage space registry at https://cloud.paris.test. When she accepts that share her clients will be able to sync the new storage space at https://cloud.zurich.test.\noCIS microservice runtime The oCIS runtime allows us to dynamically manage services running in a single process. We use suture to create a supervisor tree that starts each service in a dedicated goroutine. By default oCIS will start all built-in oCIS services in a single process. Individual services can be moved to other nodes to scale-out and meet specific performance requirements. A go-micro based registry allows services in multiple nodes to form a distributed microservice architecture.\noCIS Services Every oCIS service uses ocis-pkg, which implements the go-micro interfaces for servers to register and clients to lookup nodes with a service registry. We are following the 12 Factor methodology with oCIS. The uniformity of services also allows us to use the same command, logging and configuration mechanism. Configurations are forwarded from the oCIS runtime to the individual extensions.\ngo-micro While the go-micro framework provides abstractions as well as implementations for the different components in a microservice architecture, it uses a more developer focused runtime philosophy: It is used to download services from a repo, compile them on the fly and start them as individual processes. For oCIS we decided to use a more admin friendly runtime: You can download a single binary and start the contained oCIS services with a single bin/ocis server. This also makes packaging easier.\nWe use ocis-pkg to configure the default implementations for the go-micro grpc server, client and mdns registry, swapping them out as needed, e.g. to use the kubernetes registry plugin.\nREVA A lot of embedded services in oCIS are built upon the REVA runtime. We decided to bundle some of the CS3 services to logically group them. A home storage provider, which is dealing with metadata, and the corresponding data provider, which is dealing with up and download, are one example. The frontend with the oc flavoured webdav, ocs handlers and a data-gateway are another.\nProtocol driven development Interacting with oCIS involves a multitude af APIs. The server and all clients rely on OpenID Connect for authentication. The embedded LibreGraph Connect can be replaced with any other OpenID Connect Identity Provider. Clients use the WebDAV based oc sync protocol to manage files and folders, ocs to manage shares and TUS to upload files in a resumable way. On the server side REVA is the reference implementation of the CS3 apis which is defined using protobuf. By embedding libregraph/idm, oCIS provides a LDAP interface to make accounts, including guests available to firewalls and other systems. In the future, we are looking into the Microsoft Graph API, which is based on odata, as a well-defined REST/JSON dialect for the existing endpoints.\nAcceptance test suite We run a huge test suite, which originated in ownCloud 10 and continues to grow. A detailed description can be found in the developer docs for testing.\nArchitecture Overview Running bin/ocis server will start the following services, all of which can be scaled and deployed on a single node or in a cloud native environment, as needed.\n","description":"ownCloud Infinite Scale Welcome to oCIS, the modern file-sync and share platform, which is based on our knowledge and experience with the PHP based ownCloud server.\nThe idea of federated storage To create a truly federated storage architecture oCIS breaks down the old ownCloud 10 user specific namespace, which is assembled on the server side, and makes the individual parts accessible to clients as storage spaces and storage space registries."},{"id":2,"href":"/clients/ocis-php-sdk/","title":"oCIS PHP SDK","parent":"Clients","content":" ocis-php-sdk This SDK allows you to interact with ownCloud Infinite Scale (oCIS) storage using PHP.\nDocumentation You can find a rendered version of the API documentation in our dev docs.\nTo render the documentation locally, use the phpDocumentor to run it in the local repo.

Time: we want to build a release candidate asap. Firewalls need access to guests, typically via LDAP. Not all external LDAPs are writeable for us to provision Guest accounts. We see multiple LDAP servers in deployments. Being able to handle them is important and should be covered by using OIDC + being able to query multiple LDAP servers. Considered Options Accounts service wraps LDAP GLAuth wraps accounts service Decision Outcome Chosen option: \u0026ldquo;GLAuth wraps accounts service\u0026rdquo;, because we need write access to provision guest accounts and GLAuth currently has no write support.\nPositive Consequences We can build a self-contained user management in the accounts service and can adjust it to our requirements. We do not rely on an LDAP server which would only be possible by implementing write support in the LDAP libraries used by GLAuth (hard to estimate effort, when will that be merged upstream). Negative Consequences We need to spend time on implementing user management Pros and Cons of the Options Accounts service wraps LDAP Bad, because not all external LDAPs are writeable for us to provision Guest accounts.

Therefore, this section only applies to versions \u0026lt; 7.1.0.\nIntroduction ownCloud Web is being deployed as an app to ownCloud marketplace to enable easy integration into existing ownCloud 10 instances. After completing this setup, ownCloud Web will be available on https://\u0026lt;your-owncloud-server\u0026gt;/index.php/apps/web.\nPrerequisites Running ownCloud 10 server with version 10.8 Installed oauth2 app Command line access to your server Deploying ownCloud Web Download the ownCloud Web app from the marketplace and enable it:\nocc market:install web Configure oauth2 Within the Admin page of ownCloud 10, head into User Authentication and add a new client with arbitrary name (e.g. ownCloud Web) and redirection URL https://\u0026lt;your-owncloud-server\u0026gt;/index.php/apps/web/oidc-callback.html.\nYou can mark the ownCloud web client as trusted by clicking the respective checkbox so authorization after authentication gets omitted. If you use OpenID Connect you need to add a new client for ownCloud Web to your identity provider instead. Configure ownCloud 10 Set ownCloud Web address To set the ownCloud Web address and to display ownCloud Web in the app switcher, add the following line into config/config.php:\n\u0026#39;web.baseUrl\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;https://\u0026lt;your-owncloud-server\u0026gt;/index.php/apps/web\u0026#39;, Configure link routing Administrators can optionally decide whether ownCloud Links (public and private links) should be provided by the Classic web interface or by ownCloud Web using the web.rewriteLinks option in config/config.php. The option defaults to false so that the links open in the Classic web interface. Setting it to true will redirect all links to ownCloud Web. To redirect all private and public links to ownCloud Web, add the following line into config/config.php:\n\u0026#39;web.rewriteLinks\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, Make ownCloud Web the default web interface Administrators can optionally decide to make ownCloud Web the default web interface that users see after they log in to ownCloud. By default, the Classic web interface will be presented to users.

You can use the following example and customize it according to your needs.\nAll apps that are listed in the ownCloud Classic app switcher will be added as links to the app switcher of the new ownCloud Web automatically. All of those links will open in a new browser tab on click. To add new elements in the app switcher, paste the following into the applications section of config.json:\n{ \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Custom Groups\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;de\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Benutzerdefinierte Gruppen\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;settings-4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://\u0026lt;your-owncloud-server\u0026gt;/settings/personal?sectionid=customgroups\u0026#34; } The URL in the example might need adaptations depending on the configuration of your ownCloud Server. App switcher elements added this way will open the respective page in a new tab. This method can also be used to link external sites like Help pages or similar. Add links to the user menu Just like adding links to the app switcher, you can also add links to the user menu.\n{ \u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;settings-4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;menu\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;_self\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;de\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hilfe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Help\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://help-link.example\u0026#34; } This will add a link to the specified URL in the user menu. This way, the link will open in the same tab. If you instead want to open it in a new tab, just remove the line \u0026quot;target\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;_self\u0026quot;,.\nONLYOFFICE For ONLYOFFICE there is a native integration available for ownCloud Web when it is used with ownCloud Classic Server. It fully integrates the ONLYOFFICE Document Editors and allows users to create and open documents right from ownCloud Web.\nTo be able to use ONLYOFFICE in ownCloud Web, it is required to run\nownCloud Server \u0026gt;= 10.8 ownCloud Web \u0026gt;= 4.0.0 ONLYOFFICE Connector for ownCloud Classic \u0026gt;= 7.1.1 Make sure that ONLYOFFICE works as expected in the Classic UI and add the following to config.json to make it available in ownCloud Web:\n\u0026#34;external_apps\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;onlyoffice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://\u0026lt;your-owncloud-server\u0026gt;/apps-external/onlyoffice/js/web/onlyoffice.js\u0026#34; } ] The URL in the example might need adaptations depending on the configuration of your ownCloud Server. Collabora Online For Collabora Online there is a native integration available for ownCloud Web when it is used with ownCloud Classic Server. It fully integrates the Collabora Online Document Editors and allows users to create and open documents right from ownCloud Web.\nTo be able to use Collabora Online in ownCloud Web, it is required to run\nownCloud Server \u0026gt;= 10.8 ownCloud Web \u0026gt;= 4.0.0 Collabora Online Connector for ownCloud Classic \u0026gt;= 2.7.0 Make sure that Collabora Online works as expected in the Classic UI and add the following to config.json to make it available in ownCloud Web:\n\u0026#34;external_apps\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;richdocuments\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://\u0026lt;your-owncloud-server\u0026gt;/apps/richdocuments/js/richdocuments.js\u0026#34; } ] The URL in the example might need adaptations depending on the configuration of your ownCloud Server. Additional configuration for certain core apps There is additional configuration available for certain core apps. You can find them listed below.\nPreview app In case the backend has additional preview providers configured there is no mechanism, yet, to announce those to the Preview app in ownCloud Web. As an intermediate solution you can add the additional supported mimeTypes to the Preview app by following these steps:\nRemove the \u0026quot;preview\u0026quot; string from the \u0026quot;apps\u0026quot; section in your config.json file Add the following config to your config.json file: \u0026#34;external_apps\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;preview\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;web-app-preview\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;mimeTypes\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;image/tiff\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;image/webp\u0026#34;] } } ] If you already have an \u0026quot;external_apps\u0026quot; section, just add the preview app to the list. Please adjust the \u0026quot;mimeTypes\u0026quot; list according to your additional preview providers. See https://github.com/owncloud/files_mediaviewer#supporting-more-media-types for advise on how to add preview providers to the backend.\nText-Editor app The text-editor app provides a list of file extensions that the app is associated with, both for opening files and for creating new files. By default, only .txt and .md files appear in the file creation menu and offer the text-editor as default app on a left mouse click in the file list. For other file types the text-editor app only appears in the right mouse click context menu. In case you want to change this default set of primary file extensions for the text-editor you can overwrite it as follows:\nRemove the \u0026quot;text-editor\u0026quot; string from the \u0026quot;apps\u0026quot; section in your config.json file Add the following config to your config.json file: \u0026#34;external_apps\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-editor\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;web-app-text-editor\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;primaryExtensions\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;txt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;yaml\u0026#34;] } } ] With the above example config the text editor will offer creation of new files for .txt and .yaml files instead of .txt and .md files. Also, a left mouse click on any .txt or .yaml file will open the respective file in the text-editor app. In this example, .md files would not be opened in the text-editor by default anymore, but the text-editor will would appear in the context menu for the file as alternative app.\nIf you already have an \u0026quot;external_apps\u0026quot; section, just add the preview app to the list. Please adjust the \u0026quot;mimeTypes\u0026quot; list according to your additional preview providers. See https://github.com/owncloud/files_mediaviewer#supporting-more-media-types for advise on how to add preview providers to the backend.\nThe reason why the app needs to be ported from the apps section to the external_apps section is that only the external_apps support additional configuration. There are plans to change the configuration of apps to give you a coherent admin experience in that regard. Accessing ownCloud Web After following all the steps, you should see a new entry in the application switcher called New Design which points to the ownCloud web.\n","description":"Compatibility Introduction Prerequisites Deploying ownCloud Web Configure oauth2 Configure ownCloud 10 Set ownCloud Web address Configure link routing Make ownCloud Web the default web interface Configure ownCloud Web Integrate ownCloud Classic features in ownCloud Web Add links to the app switcher Add links to the user menu ONLYOFFICE Collabora Online Additional configuration for certain core apps Preview app Text-Editor app Accessing ownCloud Web Compatibility Please note that the usage of Web UI and ownCloud 10 as backend is not recommended starting with version 7."},{"id":6,"href":"/ocis/config/","title":"Configuration","parent":"oCIS - ownCloud Infinite Scale","content":" Configuration Framework Overview of the approach In-depth configuration Flows Examples Expected loading locations Only config files Using ENV variables Workflows Supervised Unsupervised Shared Values Log config keys Default config values (in yaml) Configuration Framework In order to simplify deployments and development the configuration model from oCIS aims to be simple yet flexible.\nOverview of the approach In-depth configuration Since we include a set of predefined extensions within the single binary, configuring an extension can be done in a variety of ways. Since we work with complex types, having as many cli per config value scales poorly, so we limited the options to config files and environment variables.\nThe hierarchy is clear enough, leaving us with:\n(each element above overwrites its precedent)\nenv variables extension config ocis config This is manifested in the previous diagram. We can then speak about \u0026ldquo;configuration file arithmetics\u0026rdquo;, where resulting config transformations happen through a series of steps. An administrator must be aware of these sources, since mis-managing them can be a source of confusion, having undesired transformations on config files believed not to be applied.\nFlows Let\u0026rsquo;s explore the various flows with examples and workflows.\nExamples Let\u0026rsquo;s explore with examples this approach.\nExpected loading locations docker images: /etc/ocis/ binary releases: $HOME/.ocis/config/ followed by the \u0026lt;extension name\u0026gt;.yaml, eg proxy.yaml for the extension configuration. You also can put an ocis.yaml config file to the expected loading location to use a single config file.\nYou can set another directory as config path in the environment variable OCIS_CONFIG_DIR. It will then pick the same file names, but from the folder you configured.\nOnly config files The following config files are present in the default loading locations:\nocis.yaml\nproxy: http: addr: localhost:1111 log: pretty: false color: false level: info log: pretty: true color: true level: info proxy.yaml\nhttp: addr: localhost:3333 Note that the extension files will overwrite values from the main ocis.yaml, causing ocis server to run with the following configuration:\nproxy: http: addr: localhost:3333 log: pretty: true color: true level: info Using ENV variables The logging configuration if defined in the main ocis.yaml is inherited by all extensions. It can be, however, overwritten by a single extension file if desired. The same example can be used to demonstrate environment values overwrites. With the same set of config files now we have the following command PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=localhost:5555 ocis server, now the resulting config looks like:\nproxy: http: addr: localhost:5555 log: pretty: true color: true level: info Workflows Since one can run an extension using the runtime (supervised) or not (unsupervised), we ensure correct behavior in both modes, expecting the same outputs.\nSupervised You are using the supervised mode whenever you issue the ocis server command. We start the runtime on port 9250 (by default) that listens for commands regarding the lifecycle of the supervised extensions. When an extension runs supervised and is killed, the only way to provide / overwrite configuration values will be through an extension config file. This is due to the parent process has already started, and it already has its own environment.\nUnsupervised All the points from the priority section hold true. An unsupervised extension can be started with the format: ocis [extension] i.e: ocis proxy. First, ocis.yaml is parsed, then proxy.yaml followed by environment variables.\nShared Values When running in supervised mode (ocis server) it is beneficial to have common values for logging, so that the log output is correctly formatted, or everything is piped to the same file without duplicating config keys and values all over the place. This is possible using the global log config key:\nocis.yaml\nlog: level: error color: true pretty: true file: /var/tmp/ocis_output.log There is, however, the option for extensions to overwrite this global values by declaring their own logging directives:\nocis.yaml\nlog: level: info color: false pretty: false One can go as far as to make the case of an extension overwriting its shared logging config that received from the main ocis.yaml file. Because things can get out of hands pretty fast we recommend not mixing logging configuration values and either use the same global logging values for all extensions.\nWhen overwriting a globally shared logging values, one MUST specify all values. Log config keys log: level: [ error | warning | info | debug ] color: [ true | false ] pretty: [ true | false ] file: [ path/to/log/file ] # MUST not be used with pretty = true Default config values (in yaml) TBD. Needs to be generated and merged with the env mappings.\n","description":"Configuration Framework Overview of the approach In-depth configuration Flows Examples Expected loading locations Only config files Using ENV variables Workflows Supervised Unsupervised Shared Values Log config keys Default config values (in yaml) Configuration Framework In order to simplify deployments and development the configuration model from oCIS aims to be simple yet flexible.\nOverview of the approach In-depth configuration Since we include a set of predefined extensions within the single binary, configuring an extension can be done in a variety of ways."},{"id":7,"href":"/integration/file_picker/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started","parent":"File Picker","content":" Components of the File picker File picker Location picker ownCloud File picker is a web component which can be integrated into existing web applications.

Email and username can change when a user changes his name. But even the OIDC sub+iss combination may change when the IdP changes. While there is an account porting protocol that describes how a relying party (RP) such as ownCloud should behave, it still requires the RP to maintain its own user identifiers.\nDecision Drivers oCIS should be a single binary that can run out of the box without external dependencies like an LDAP server. Time: we want to build a release candidate asap. oCIS should be able to be easily integrated with standard user management components Considered Options Accounts service wraps LDAP GLAuth wraps accounts service Decision Outcome Chosen option: \u0026ldquo;Move accounts functionality to GLAuth and name it accounts\u0026rdquo;, by moving the existing accounts service file based persistence to GLAuth and use it as a drop in replacement for an LDAP server. The reverse index and web UI existing in the accounts service will move as well in order to make GLAuth a standalone, small scale user management with write capabilities.\nProduct summary GLAuth is a drop in user management for small scale deployments that do not rely on an actual LDAP server. oCIS admins can either use the web UI to manage users in GLAuth or use existing tools in their IDM. We hide the complexity by embedding an OpenID Provider, an LDAP server and a user management web UI. Resulting deployment options Use internal user management Recommended for small scale use cases and simple deployments Users, groups and roles are stored and managed within GLAuth Use external user management Recommended for mid and large scale use cases Users, groups and roles are stored and managed within an external LDAP / AD / IDM Separate oCIS and LDAP admin: oCIS admin relies on the LDAP admin to manage users User permissions for roles are always managed in oCIS (settings service) because they are specific to oCIS Resulting technical implications Make the file based reverse index a standalone library Contribute to GLAuth Add ms graph based rest API to manage users, groups and roles (the LDAP lib is currently readonly) Add web UI to glauth that uses the ms graph based rest API to manage users Add a backend that uses the file based reverse index, currently living in the oCIS accounts service Move fallback mechanism from ocis/glauth service to upstream GLAuth to support multiple LDAP servers Make it a chain to support more than two LDAP servers Document the implications for merging result sets when searching for recipients At least one writeable backend is needed to support creating guest accounts Make all services currently using the accounts service talk to the CS3 userprovider To support multiple LDAP servers we need to move the fallback mechanism in ocis/glauth service to upstream GLAuth The current CS3 API for user management should be enriched with pagination, field mask and a query language as needed properly register an auxiliary LDAP schema that adds an ownCloudUUID attribute to users and groups Positive Consequences The accounts service (which is our drop in LDAP solution) can be dropped. The CS3 userprovider service becomes the only service dealing with users. No sync Negative Consequences If users want to store users in their IDM and at the same time guests in a separate user management we need to implement GLAuth backends that support more than one LDAP server. Pros and Cons of the Options GLAuth wraps accounts service Currently, the accounts service is the source of truth and we use it to implement user management.\nGood, because it solves the problem of storing and looking up an owncloud UUID for a user (and group) Good, because we can manage users out of the box Good, because we can persist accounts in a CS3 storage provider Bad, because it maintains a separate user repository: it needs to either learn or sync users. Move accounts functionality to GLAuth and name it accounts We should use an existing LDAP server and make GLAuth a drop in replacement for it.\nGood, because we can use an existing user repository (an LDAP server), no need to sync or learn users. Good, because admins can rely on existing user management tools. Good, because we would have a clear separation of concerns: users reside in whatever repository, typically an LDAP server could be an existing LDAP server or AD could be our embeddable drop in glauth server we use a service to wrap the LDAP server with other APIs: ms graph API - ODATA based restful API, SCIM - designed to manage user identities, supported by some IDPs, the current accounts API (which is a protobuf spec following the ms graph API) our account management UI can use the ms graph based API service which can have different backends an existing LDAP server our drop in glauth server (which might serve the ms graph based API itself) the CS3 API + a future guest provisioning API + a future CS3 user provisioning API (or generic space provisioning) all oCIS services can use the service registry to look up the accounts service that provides an internal API could be the CS3 user provider (and API) could be the internal protobuf accounts API introduce a new guest provisioning API to CS3 which properly captures our requirement to have them in the user repository guests need to be made available to the firewall storages like EOS that integrate with the os for acl based file permissions need a numeric user and group id Good, because we can use the CS3 user provider with the existing LDAP / rest driver. Bad, because oCIS admins may not have the rights to manage role assignments. (But this is handled at a different department.) Bad, because oCIS admins may not have the rights to disable users if an external LDAP is used instead of the drop in GLAuth. Links supersedes ADR-0001 superseded by 17.

The full set of options is listed below in two examples. One for authentication with OAuth2 and one with OpenID Connect.\nThere are different ways of providing the config JSON to the file picker:\nAs a JSON object via a prop called configObject As a JSON string via the same prop (configObject) As a URL via a prop called configLocation. This requires full URL address (e.g. https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;path-to-the-config\u0026gt;) If none of the props (configObject or configLocation) is defined, the file picker has a configLocation of https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/file-picker-config.json as fallback Location of the file can be provided via a prop called configLocation. This requires full URL address (e.g. https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;path-to-the-config\u0026gt;). If the prop is not defined, the location will fallback to https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/file-picker-config.json. The config can point to both oauth2 and OIDC. You can take a look at the following example to see how OIDC can be defined:\nOpenID Connect config { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;owncloud-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;openIdConnect\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;metadata_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/.well-known/openid-configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;client_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;client-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;response_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;openid profile email\u0026#34; } } OAuth2 config { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;owncloud-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;auth\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;oauth2-client-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/index.php/apps/oauth2/api/v1/token\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/index.php/apps/oauth2/authorize\u0026#34; } } Pass bearer token In case you already have a bearer token and want to skip the whole authorization process inside of the File picker, you can pass it to the component via prop called bearerToken.\nInstall File picker package To integrate File picker into your own product, you can install it via one of the following commands:\nnpm install @ownclouders/file-picker --save # OR yarn add @ownclouders/file-picker # OR pnpm add @ownclouders/file-picker Select browser storage In order to authorize any request to the ownCloud server, we are storing the Bearer token in a browser storage. By default, it is the session storage. As browsers are adding more strict policies when it comes to blocking third party cookies, your users might experience issues with the token not being saved in the storage. For this reason, it is possible to specify a storage name in the config of File picker. To make it possible to run the File picker inside of an iframe, specify storage: memory.\nIf the memory storage is used, it is not persisted in the session. This leads to users having to authorize again after a refresh has happened. Users might still be experiencing issues with the authentication even if the memory storage is used. That can happen due to the authentication popup needing to trigger a callback in the File picker. To make sure it will work as supposed, be sure to set correct CORS headers. Integrate in HTML page with vanilla JavaScript When including File picker in an HTML page, it is important to include Vue.js as well. In this case, we will import it via unpkg. Without this, the component won\u0026rsquo;t work.

Since the web component will be imported before Vue, we need to define it as a global variable on our own. This requires us to separate the import of Vue into a bootstrap file.\nvue.js:\nimport Vue from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; window.Vue = Vue main.js:\nimport Vue from \u0026#39;./vue\u0026#39; new Vue(...) \u0026lt;template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file-picker variation=\u0026#34;location\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; import FilePicker from \u0026#39;@ownclouders/file-picker\u0026#39; import \u0026#39;@ownclouders/file-picker/dist/lib/file-picker.css\u0026#39; export default: { components: { FilePicker } } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Set correct variation As described in Getting Started, File picker comes in two variations. To define which one should be used, you need to pass it to the component via its variation property. Valid values are:\nresource - File picker location - Location picker Theming File picker comes by default with extracted stylesheet which combines our ownCloud Design System and a few custom styles. If you want to create a custom theme, do not include our stylesheet and create a custom one using File picker selectors.\nButtons and events The wording of buttons can be customized.\nSelect button The file picker has a button in the top right for emitting an event with the selected location or resource, depending on the configured variation. This button has default labels, depending on the chosen variation. However, it is possible to define a different button label by setting select-btn-label=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;your select button label\u0026gt;\u0026quot;. Using the select button will emit an event with the name selectResources.\nCancel button Cancellation for the file picker is disabled by default. When a label is provided, the file picker renders a cancel button on the left side of the select button. This can be achieved by setting cancel-btn-label=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;your cancel button label\u0026gt;\u0026quot;. This will also add a keyboard event on the ESC key. Using the cancel button or the ESC key on the keyboard will emit an event with the name cancel.\n","description":"Setup authentication OpenID Connect config OAuth2 config Pass bearer token Install File picker package Select browser storage Integrate in HTML page with vanilla JavaScript Integrate in Vue web application Set correct variation Theming Buttons and events Select button Cancel button Setup authentication The config for the server backend and authentication needs to be provided in json format.

Decision Outcome Chosen option: \u0026ldquo;[option 1]\u0026rdquo;, because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].\nPositive Consequences [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …] … Negative Consequences [e.g., compromising quality attribute, follow-up decisions required, …] … Pros and Cons of the Options Cold Migration The migration happens while the service is offline. File metadata, blobs and share data is exported from ownCloud 10 and imported in oCIS. This can happen user by user, where every user export would contain the file blobs, their metadata, trash, versions, shares and all metadata that belongs to the user\u0026rsquo;s storage. To prevent group shares from breaking, users in the same groups must be migrated in batch. Depending on the actual group shares in an instance this may effectively require a complete migration in a single batch.\nGood, because oCIS can be tested in a staging system without writing to the production system. Good, because file layout on disk can be changed to support new storage driver capabilities. Bad, because the export and import might require significant amounts of storage. Bad, because a rollback to the state before the migration might cause data loss of the changes that happened in between. Bad, because the cold migration can mean significant downtime. Hot Migration The migration happens in subsequent stages while the service is online.\nGood, because the admin can migrate users from old to new backend in a controlled way. Good, because users and admins can learn to trust the new system. Good, because there can be preparations even long before the migrations happens in parallel on the oC10 codebase, i.e. addition of metadata that is needed while the system operates. Good, because the downtime of the system can be fairly small. Bad, because it is more complex and might drag on for a long time.

Account Management through CS3 API","parent":"Architecture Decisions","content":" Status: proposed Deciders: @refs, @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-04-12 Technical Story: Write only management API for User and Group resources\nContext and Problem Statement What would be a more effective way of using network resources and handle account management within the oCIS-Reva ecosystem? Separating account management at the service level is pragmatic and allows for fast iterations, but also steadily accumulates inconsistencies and bloats technical debt.\nDecision Drivers Reduce number of network calls. Reduce number of services (merge Account + GLAuth from ADR-0003). Formalize account management at the API level. Considered Options Account management delegated to vendors. Add account management to the CS3 API. Decision Outcome Chosen option: \u0026ldquo;Add account management to the CS3 API\u0026rdquo;. Making the API declare an API for account management will not only allow a deployment to fail fast (as in: the management node is not running) but would also centralize all management operations that should happen to be constrained within the Reva context. Constrained operations SHOULD be by definition more secure, or at least as secure as the rest of the system.\nPositive Consequences More resilient API. Because account management is considered a \u0026ldquo;first class citizen\u0026rdquo; changes are forced to go through a more exhaustive revision process. Removing Accounts from search users1. Replace the provisioning API in favor of the new Reva Admin node. (1) the current vendor implementation of searching a user (i.e: when sharing a resource) relies directly on the accounts service, since this is the only source of truth. Searching a user looks like:\n┌────────────────────────────────────────┐ │user search (no LDAP) │ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ proxy │ │ │ │ │ ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐ │ │ └──────────┘ go-micro │ │ ▲ │ │ │ │ │ Λ │ │ ▼ │ ╱ ╲ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ ╱ ╲ │ │ │ │ │ ╱ ╲ │ │ │ │ ocs │◀──(1)───▶registry▏ │ │ │ │ │ ╲ ╱ │ │ │ └──────────┘ ╲ ╱ │ │ ▲ │ ╲ ╱ │ │ │ │ V │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────▶│ accounts │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │(1) ocs requests a connection to the │ │accounts service to the registry │ │ │ └────────────────────────────────────────┘ Whereas, as a result of ADR-0003 and this ADR, we can simplify and improve this design:\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │user search │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ proxy │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ ▼ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ocs │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│─ ─ ─ ─ ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐ │ │ reva ▼ │ IDM │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ users │◀─────┼──▶│ GLAuth │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ └ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘ │ │ │ └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ And instead rely on the already existing Reva users provider.\nPros and Cons of the Options Account management delegated to vendors Good, because it allows for fast iterations. Bad, because account management happens outside of the Reva process. This can potentially end up in invalid account creation / deletion / updates. An example with the existing Accounts service is that any client can fire CRUD accounts requests to the Accounts service as long as the client knows where the server is running and provides with an Authorization header (only required by the proxy). This request totally bypasses Reva middlewares and therefore any security measures that should be enforced by the entire system. Bad, because leaves teams the task of designing and implementing a way of dealing with account management. Ideally one schema should be provided / suggested. Creating an account using the first option looks currently is implemented in vendors as:\n┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ creating a user (webui) │ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ proxy │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ /api/v0/accounts/accounts-create │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ▼ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ accounts │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ note that while doing CRUD operations changes │ │ are instantly reflected for the IDP since out of │ │ the box oCIS uses an accounts backend for │ │ GLAuth. │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ As explained before, during this flow no Reva middlewares are run. Creating an account will only use the embedded accounts js file alongside a minted jwt token (by the oCIS proxy) to communicate with the accounts service.\nAdd account management to the CS3 API Good, because it solidifies what the CS3 API can or cannot do, and account management should be handled at the API level since ultimately accounts would contain a mix of required CS3 and vendor-specific attributes. Good, because it centralizes account management and constrains it within the Reva boundaries. Good, because there is a clear separation of concerns on what is accounts management logic. Good, because we already designed a similar API for the accounts service the only difference being we (vendors) define their own messages. The API would fully include CRUD methods Bad, because development cycles are larger. an example flow will be: update api \u0026gt; run prototool \u0026gt; publish language specific packages \u0026gt; update dependencies to fetch latest version of the package \u0026gt; utilize the new changes. The new account management workflow will result in:\n┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │creating a user (webui) │ │ - maintain the same route for compatibility │ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ proxy │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ /api/v0/accounts/accounts-create │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─│─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┐ ┌ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ │ │ Reva │ IDM │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ▼ │ │ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ admin │───────────┼──┼──▶│ GLAuth │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ └──────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ an example of a driver could be GLAuth │ │ implementing the user management portion of the │ │ GraphAPI │ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ This flow allows Reva and oCIS Proxy to run any middleware logic in order to validate a request.

There were some drawbacks regarding this due to introducing go-micro to Reva was from start an issue. Given the little usage of go-micro we need, we decided instead to define our very own Registry interface on Reva and extended the runtime arguments to allow for injecting a registry.\nPositive Consequences Having dynamic service registration delegates the entire lifecycle of finding a process to the service registry. Removing a-priori knowledge of hostname + port for services. Marrying go-micro\u0026rsquo;s registry and a newly defined registry abstraction on Reva. We will embrace go-micro interfaces by defining a third merger interface in order to marry go-micro registry and reva registry. The ability to fetch a service node relying only on its name (i.e: com.owncloud.proxy) and not on a tuple hostname + port that we rely on being preconfigured during runtime. Conceptually speaking, a better framework to tie all the services together. Referring to services by names is less overall confusing than having to add a service name + where it is running. A registry is agnostic to \u0026ldquo;where is it running\u0026rdquo; because it, by definition, keeps track of this specific question, so when speaking about design or functionality, it will ease communication. Pros and Cons of the Options Hardcoded tuples of hostname + port Good, because firewalls are easier to configure since IP are static. Good, because the mental model required is easier to grasp as IP addresses can be easily bundled. Bad, because it requires thorough planning of ports. Dynamic service registration Good, because it abstracts the use of service lookup away to registry logic from the admin or developer. Good, because it allows for, through interfaces, registry injection This means we can have a service registry that we extensively use in oCIS and inject its functionality onto Reva.

In oc10 all requests at this endpoint use a path based reference that is relative to the users home. In oCIS this can be configured and defaults to /home as well. Other API endpoints like ocs and the web UI still expect this to be the users home.\nIn oc10 we originally had remote.php/webdav which would render the current users home storage space. The early versions (pre OC7) would jail all received shares into a remote.php/webdav/shares subfolder. The semantics for syncing such a folder are not trivially predictable, which is why we made shares freely mountable anywhere in the users home.\nThe current reva implementation jails shares into a remote.php/webdav/Shares folder for performance reasons. Obviously, this brings back the special semantics for syncing. In the future we will follow a different solution and jail the received shares into a dedicated /shares space, on the same level as /home and /spaces. We will add a dedicated API to list all storage spaces a user has access to and where they are mounted in the users namespace.\nTODO rewrite this hint with /dav/spaces Existing folder sync pairs in legacy clients will break when moving the user home down in the path hierarchy like CernBox did. For legacy clients the remote.php/webdav endpoint will no longer list the users home directly, but instead present the different types of storage spaces:\nremote.php/webdav/home: the users home is pushed down into a new home storage space remote.php/webdav/shares: all mounted shares will be moved to a new shares storage space remote.php/webdav/spaces: other storage spaces the user has access to, e.g. group or project drives Sharing The OCS Share API endpoint /ocs/v1.php/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares returns shares, which have their own share id and reference files using a path relative to the users home. They API also lists the numeric storage id as well as the string type storage_id (which is confusing \u0026hellip; but yeah) which would allow constructing combined references with a storage space id and a path relative to the root of that storage space. The web UI however assumes that it can take the path from the file_target and append it to the users home to access it.\nThe API already returns the storage id (and numeric id) in addition to the file id:\n\u0026lt;storage_id\u0026gt;home::auser\u0026lt;/storage_id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;storage\u0026gt;993\u0026lt;/storage\u0026gt; \u0026lt;item_source\u0026gt;3994486\u0026lt;/item_source\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file_source\u0026gt;3994486\u0026lt;/file_source\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file_parent\u0026gt;3994485\u0026lt;/file_parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;file_target\u0026gt;/Shared/Paris.jpg\u0026lt;/file_target\u0026gt; Creating shares only takes the path as the argument so creating and navigating shares only needs the path. When you update or delete a share it takes the share id not the file id.\nThe OCS service makes a stat request to the storage provider to get a ResourceInfo object. It contains both, a ResourceId and an absolute path. If the resource exists a request is sent to the gateway. Depending on the type of share the Collaboration API, the Link API or the Open Cloud Mesh API endpoints are used.\nAPI Request Resource identified by Grant type Further arguments Collaboration CreateShareRequest ResourceInfo ShareGrant - Link CreatePublicShareRequest ResourceInfo Link Grant We send the public link name in the ArbitraryMetadata of the ResourceInfo Open Cloud Mesh CreateOCMShareRequest ResourceId OCM ShareGrant OCM ProviderInfo The user and public share provider implementations identify the file using the ResourceId. The ResourceInfo is passed so the share provider can also store who the owner of the resource is. The path is not part of the other API calls, e.g. when listing shares. The OCM API takes an id based reference on the CS3 api, even if the OCM HTTP endpoint takes a path argument. @jfd: Why? Does it not need the owner? It only stores the owner of the share, which is always the currently logged-in user, when creating a share. Afterwards only the owner can update a share \u0026hellip; so collaborative management of shares is not possible. At least for OCM shares. REVA Storage Registry The reva storage registry manages the CS3 global namespace: It is used by the reva gateway to look up address and port of the storage provider that should handle a reference.\n","description":"The current implementation in oCIS might not yet fully reflect this concept.

Open Graph API for oCIS File Spaces","parent":"Architecture Decisions","content":" Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @hodyroff, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-03-19 Technical Story: API to enable the concept of Spaces\nContext and Problem Statement As one of the building blocks for Spaces in oCIS we plan to add an API that returns information about available spaces. This ADR discusses the API design oriented on the Microsoft Graph API.\nNote: The term \u0026ldquo;spaces\u0026rdquo; is used here in the context of \u0026ldquo;a space where files can be saved\u0026rdquo;, similar to a directory. It is not to be confused with space in the sense of free file space for example.\nThe purpose of this new API is to give clients a very simple way to query the dynamic list of spaces, that the user has access to. Clients can provide a better user experience with that.\nThis API is supposed to be queried often, to give clients a condensed view of the available spaces for a user, but also their eTags and cTags. Hence the clients do not have to perform a PROPFIND for every space separately.\nThis API would even allow providing (WebDAV-) endpoints depending on the kind and version of the client asking for it.\nDecision Drivers Make it easy to work with a dynamic list of spaces of a user for the clients. No longer the need to make assumptions about WebDAV- and other routes in clients. More meta data available about spaces for a better user experience. Part of the bigger spaces plan. Important to consider in client migration scenarios, i.e. in CERN. Considered Options Microsoft Graph API inspired API that provides the requested information. Decision Outcome This the DRAFT for the API.\nAPI to Get Info about Spaces ownCloud servers provide an API to query for available spaces of an user.\nSee the openAPI Specification for the Libre Graph API.\nMost important, the API returns the WebDAV endpoint for each space. With that, clients do not have to make assumptions about WebDAV routes any more.\nSee Drive item in Microsoft Graph API for an overview of drive and driveItem resources. The concrete list of drives / spaces a user has access to can be obtained on multiple endpoints.\nGet \u0026ldquo;Home folder\u0026rdquo; Retrieve information about the home space of a user. Note: The user has access to more spaces. This call only returns the home space to provide API parity with the Graph API.\nAPI Call: /me/drive: Returns the information about the users home folder.\nGet All Spaces of a User Retrieve a list of available spaces of a user. This includes all spaces the user has access to at that moment, also the home space.\nAPI Call: /me/drives: Returns a list of spaces.\nThere is also /drives, returning the list of spaces the user has access to. This endpoint is used to access any space by id using /drives/{drive-id}.\nCommon Reply The reply to both calls is either one or a list of Drive representation objects:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdDateTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string (timestamp)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;driveType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;personal | projectSpaces | shares\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastModifiedDateTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string (timestamp)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;owner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;microsoft.graph.identitySet\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;quota\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;microsoft.graph.quota\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;microsoft.graph.driveItem\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;webUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;url\u0026#34; } The meaning of the objects in Open Graph API context are:\nid - a persistent and unique ID identifying the space, called Storage Space ID. driveType - describing the type of the space. owner - an owner object to whom the space belongs quota - quota information about this space root - the root driveItem object. webUrl - The URL to make this space visible in the browser. The following driveType values are available in the first step, but might be enhanced later:\npersonal: The users home space projectSpaces: The project spaces available for the user (*) shares: The share jail, contains all shares for the user (*) Other space types such as backup, hidden etc. can be added later as requested.\nNote: The projectSpaces and shares space are virtual spaces. They only contain other spaces, and no regular resources.\nThe (*) marked types are not defined in the official MS API. They are prefixed with oc to avoid namespace clashes.\nThe root object equals a driveItem and contains information about the root resource (directory) of the space.\nThis is an example object as it can be expected as root element.

Note: To indicate that only the metadata of a resource has changed, the eTag has changed, but the cTag not.\nPositive Consequences A well understood and mature API from Microsoft adopted to our needs. Prerequisite for Spaces in oCIS. Enables further steps in client development. Negative Consequences Migration impact on existing installations. Still to be investigated. Requires additional webdav endpoint that allows accessing an arbitrary storage space, either with an id: /dav/spaces/\u0026lt;spaceid\u0026gt;/relative/path/to/file.ext, or with a global path: /dav/global/\u0026lt;accessible\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;mount\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;point\u0026gt;/relative/path/to/file.ext, e.g. /dav/global/projects/Golive 2021/Resources/slides.odt Open Topics What are the WebDAV paths for Trashbin, Versions option: additional entries in the reply struct The identitySet object used for \u0026ldquo;owner\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;coowner\u0026rdquo; require to implement the https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/graph/api/resources/identityset?view=graph-rest-1.0 JSON object, which contains information that seems to be of limited benefit for oCIS.

Try docker compose exec ocis ocis version.\nPersist data, restart and logging The key to a successful container setup is the persistence of the application data to make the data survive a re-boot. Docker normally uses volumes for this purpose. A volume can either be a \u0026ldquo;named volume\u0026rdquo; which are completely managed by docker and have many advantages (see the linked docker documentation), or \u0026ldquo;bind mounts\u0026rdquo; which are using the directory structure and OS of the host system. In our example we already use a bind mount for the config file. We will now add a named volume for the oCIS data directory.\nThis is the way we should configure the ocis service:\nvolumes: # mount the ocis config file inside the container - \u0026#34;./ocis.yaml:/etc/ocis/ocis.yaml\u0026#34; # short syntax for using a named volume # in the form \u0026lt;volume name\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;mount path in the container\u0026gt; # use a named volume for the ocis data directory - \u0026#34;ocis-data:/var/lib/ocis\u0026#34; # or the more verbose syntax #- type: volume # source: ocis-data # name of the volume # target: /var/lib/ocis # the mount path inside the container The docker-compose.yml needs to declare the named volumes globally, add this at the bottom of the file:\n# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes # this declares the named volume with all default settings # you can also see the volume when running `docker volume list` volumes: ocis-data: Now let us configure the restart policy and the logging settings for the ocis service:\n# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#restart restart: always # or on-failure / unless-stopped # https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/ # https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#logging # the default log driver does no log rotation # you can switch to the \u0026#34;local\u0026#34; log driver which does rotation by default logging: driver: local # otherwise you could specify log rotation explicitly # driver: \u0026#34;json-file\u0026#34; # this is the default driver # options: # max-size: \u0026#34;200k\u0026#34; # limit the size of the log file # max-file: \u0026#34;10\u0026#34; # limit the count of the log files Apply your changes! Just run docker compose up -d again.\nNow you have an oCIS which will survive reboots, restart automatically and has log rotation by default.\nAccess the logs via docker compose logs -f and do some actions in the frontend to see the effect. Create data by uploading files and adding more users. Then run docker compose down to shut oCIS down. Start it again docker compose up -d, log in again and check that your data has survived the reboot.\nPin the oCIS version Last but not least, it is never a good idea to use the latest docker tag.

Configuration","parent":"Architecture Decisions","content":" Status: proposed Deciders: @refs, @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-05-03 Context and Problem Statement As per urfave/cli\u0026rsquo;s doc:\nThe precedence for flag value sources is as follows (highest to lowest):\nCommand line flag value from user Environment variable (if specified) Configuration file (if specified) Default defined on the flag An issue arises in point 2, in the sense that configuration file refers to a single file containing the value for the env variable. The CLI framework we use for flag parsing does not support merging config structs with CLI flags. This introduces an inconsistency with the framework: config structs are not supported, and we cannot hook to the lifecycle of the flags parsing to use a file as source and conform to these rules.\nBecause we solely rely on structured configuration we need a way to modify values in this struct using the provided means urfave/cli gives us (flags, env variables, config files and default value), but since we have different modes of operation (supervised Vs. unsupervised) we have to define a clear line.\nDecision Drivers Improve experience for the end user. Improve experience for developers. Sane defaults. Sane overrides. Considered Options Extend FlagInputSourceExtension interface Feature request: support for structured configuration (urfave/cli). Clearly defined boundaries of what can and cannot be done. Expose structured field values as CLI flags Drop support for structure configuration Adapt the \u0026ldquo;structured config files have the highest priority\u0026rdquo; within oCIS Decision Outcome [STILL UNDECIDED]\nPositive Consequences [TBD, depends on Decision Outcome]\nPros and Cons of the Options Extend FlagInputSourceExtension interface Good, because we could still use Viper to load from config files here and apply values to the flags in the context. Bad, because urfave/cli team are actively working on v3 of altsrc and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to maintain yet another slice of the codebase. notes: source is FlagInputSourceExtension interface\nFeature request: support for structured configuration (urfave/cli). Good, because we could remove Viper off the codebase and solely rely on urfave/cli\u0026rsquo;s native code. Bad, because there are no plans to support this upstream. Clearly defined boundaries of what can and cannot be done. Good, because no changes to the codebase required (not drastic changes.) Bad, because we\u0026rsquo;re limited by the framework Expose structured field values as CLI flags Good, because it has been already taken into account on large projects (kubernetes) here. in point 5. Bad, because it requires quite a bit1 of custom logic. Bad, because how should these flags be present in the -h menu of a subcommand? Probably some code generation needed. *[1] this is a big uncertainty.\nDrop support for structure configuration Good, because it makes the integration with the cli framework easier to grasp. Good, because it is not encouraged by the 12factor app spec. Bad, because we already support if and users make active use of it. At least for development. Adapt the \u0026ldquo;structured config files have the highest priority\u0026rdquo; within oCIS Good, because that would mean little structural changes to the codebase since the Viper config parsing logic already uses the Before hook to parse prior to the command\u0026rsquo;s action executes. Notes Use Cases and Expected Behaviors Supervised (ocis server or ocis run extension) Use a global config file (ocis.yaml) to configure an entire set of services: \u0026gt; ocis --config-file /etc/ocis.yaml service Use a global config file (ocis.yaml) to configure a single extension: \u0026gt; ocis --config-file /etc/ocis/yaml proxy When running in supervised mode, config files from extensions are NOT evaluated (only when running ocis server, runs with ocis run extension do parse individual config files) i.e: present config files: ocis.yaml and proxy.yaml; only the contents of ocis.yaml are loaded1. Flag parsing for subcommands are not allowed in this mode, since the runtime is in control. Configuration has to be done solely using config files. *[1] see the development section for more on this topic.\nKnown Gotchas \u0026gt; ocis --config-file /etc/ocis/ocis.yaml server does not work. It currently only supports reading global config values from the predefined locations. Unsupervised (ocis proxy) ocis.yaml is parsed first (since proxy is a subcommand of ocis) proxy.yaml is parsed if present, overriding values from ocis.yaml and any cli flag or env variable present. Other known use cases Configure via env + some configuration files like WEB_UI_CONFIG or proxy routes Configure via flags + some configuration files like WEB_UI_CONFIG or proxy routes Configure via global (single file for all extensions) config file + some configuration files like WEB_UI_CONFIG or proxy routes configure via per extension config file + some configuration files like WEB_UI_CONFIG or proxy routes Each individual use case DOES NOT mix sources (i.e: when using cli flags, do not use environment variables nor cli flags).\nLimitations on urfave/cli prevent us from providing structured configuration and framework support for cli flags + env variables.\nUse Cases for Development Config Loading Sometimes is desired to decouple the main series of services from an individual instance. We want to use the runtime to startup all services, then do work only on a single service. To achieve that one could use ocis server \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ocis kill proxy \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ocis run proxy. This series of commands will 1. load all config from ocis.yaml, 2. kill the supervised proxy service and 3. start the same service with the contents from proxy.yaml.\nStart an extension multiple times with different configs (in Supervised mode) Flag parsing on subcommands in supervised mode is not yet allowed. The runtime will first parse the global ocis.yaml (if any) and run with the loaded configuration. This use case should provide support for having 2 different proxy config files and making use of the runtime start 2 proxy services, with different values.\nFor this to work, services started via Service.Start need to forward any args as flags:\nif err := client.Call(\u0026#34;Service.Start\u0026#34;, os.Args[2], \u0026amp;reply); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } This should provide with enough flexibility for interpreting different config sources as: \u0026gt; bin/ocis run proxy --config-file /etc/ocis/unexpected/proxy.yaml\nDeveloping Considered Alternatives Further Let\u0026rsquo;s develop further the following concept: Adapt the \u0026ldquo;structured config files have the highest priority\u0026rdquo; within oCIS.\nOf course it directly contradicts urfave/cli priorities. When a command finished parsing its cli args and env variables, only after that Before is called. This mean by the time we reach a command Before hook, flags have already been parsed and its values loaded to their respective destinations within the Config struct.\nThis should still not prevent a developer from using different config files for a single service. Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze the following use case:\nglobal config file present (ocis.yaml) single proxy.yaml config file another proxy.yaml config file running under supervision mode The outcome of the following set of commands should be having all bootstrapped services running + 2 proxies on different addresses:\n\u0026gt; ocis server \u0026gt; ocis kill proxy \u0026gt; ocis run proxy --config-file proxy.yaml \u0026gt; ocis run proxy --config-file proxy2.yaml This is a desired use case that is yet not supported due to lacking of flags forwarding.\nFollow-up PR\u0026rsquo;s Variadic runtime extensions to run (development mostly) Arg forwarding to command (when running in supervised mode, forward any \u0026ndash;config-file flag to supervised subcommands) Ability to set OCIS_URL from a config file (this would require to extend the ocis-pkg/config/config.go file). The case for OCIS_URL OCIS_URL is a jack-of-all trades configuration. It is meant to ease up providing defaults and ensuring dependant services are well configured. It is an override to the following env vars:\nOCIS_IDM_ADDRESS PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER STORAGE_OIDC_ISSUER STORAGE_FRONTEND_PUBLIC_URL STORAGE_LDAP_IDP WEB_UI_CONFIG_SERVER WEB_OIDC_AUTHORITY OCIS_PUBLIC_URL Because this functionality is only available as an env var, there is no current way to \u0026ldquo;normalize\u0026rdquo; its usage with a config file. That is, there is no way to individually set OCIS_URL via config file. This is clear technical debt, and should be added functionality.\nState of the Art Kubernetes proposal on this very same topic Configuration | Pulumi Configuration can be altered via setters through the CLI.

A very good first step.\nThis article explains by the example of Nextcloud how you would migrate your data from an running NC to Infinite Scale. A prerequisite is that you have Infinite Scale already set up and running on a different domain.\nBe prepared that migration can take some time. Also, check the size of your data. This example was around 1.5 GiB of data, that obviously went fast.\nAnd of course: Have a backup! Even if this method only reads from the source, you never know.\nInstall rclone Check the rclone website on how to install rclone.\nCreate Users First, decide on a user that you want to migrate. To create the user on Infinite Scale, log in as an admin user and create the desired user. Create and set groups accordingly.\nFor the next step, you need the user credentials on both the source- and the destination cloud.\nConfigure rclone Remotes To be able to address the clouds in rclone, you need to configure so called remotes. It is nothing else than a shortcut for the combination of\nwhich kind of cloud are you talking to the URL the username the password, if one is set You need to add a configuration for both the source cloud (Nextcloud) and the target (Infinite Scale). As both talk WebDAV, the rclone manual page is accurate to follow.\nFor both, use an URL in the form of https://my.host.de/remote.php/webdav.\nOnce that is finished, the command rclone config show should give output similar to this:\n[:~/] ± rclone config show [NCoC] type = webdav url = https://nc.this.de/remote.php/webdav vendor = nextcloud user = wilma pass = zfdsaiewrafdskfjdasfxdasffdafdsafas [ocis] type = webdav url = https://infinitescale.works/remote.php/webdav vendor = owncloud user = wilma pass = cdsfasrefdsadaGkxTXjksfpqQFI5nQawqs Now, for example the directories on the Nextcloud root can be checked with rclone lsd NCoC:/.\nCopy Data To migrate the data, rclone provides the command copy. It transfers data from one remote to the other. Use the following command example to transfer the entire cloud data from Nextcloud to Infinite Scale:\nrclone copy NCoC:/ ocis:/ --no-check-certificate -P The \u0026ndash;no-check-certificate can and should be skipped if your clouds have proper certificates. The -P however, provides you with interesting statistics about the copy progress. Once you are finished, this might be the result:\n[:~/] $ rclone copy NCoC:/ ocis:/ --no-check-certificate -P Transferred: 1.228 GiB / 1.228 GiB, 100%, 10.170 MiB/s, ETA 0s Transferred: 411 / 411, 100% Elapsed time: 2m19.3s Note that while testing this, occasionally the Nextcloud was returning a 404 not found for some files. While the reason for that was not completely clear, it does not matter, because the rclone command can be repeated. It is clever enough to only copy what has changed!\nEnjoy! All done! Now you have your data on Infinite Scale.\nObviously this method has a few downsides, such as:\nThis migration requires a little of \u0026ldquo;quiet time\u0026rdquo; for migrating data. It is a user by user method where provisioning of users has to be done manually. Only data is migrated, and there is probably a data size limit in real life using this way. Private- and public shares are not migrated The trashbin, versions, comments and favorites are not migrated These are shortcomings but this is a good first step to start investigating. The other parts will be sorted as we move along.\nTo improve this guide, you are welcome to file an issue or even send a pull request.

This document researches an approach to achieve this goal, while limiting the scope to the enforcement side of it. The architecture for a policy system must be composed of 2 parts:\nLicense creation and validation Enforcement It is desirable to keep both systems isolated, since the implementation of the latter has to be done within the constraints of the codebase. The alternative is running an enforcement service and have each and every single request evaluating whether the request is valid or not.\nDecision Drivers As a team, we want to have the licensing code concentrated in a central module We don\u0026rsquo;t want to stop/start the extension whenever a policy is updated (hot reload). It must happen during runtime. Considered Options Build the evaluation engine in-house. Use third party libraries such as Open Policy Agent (a CNCF approved project written in Go) Decision Outcome Chosen option: option 2; Use third party libraries such as Open Policy Agent (a CNCF approved project written in Go)\nPositive Consequences OPA is production battle tested. Built around performance - policies evaluations are no longer than 1ms per request. Middleware friendly: we use gRPC clients all over our ecosystem; wrappers (or middlewares) is a viable way to solve this problem instead of a dedicated service or its own package. Community support. Kubernetes friendly. Supports envoy, kong, terraform, traefik, php, node and many more. Negative Consequences More vendor code inside the binary (larger attack surface, larger footprint [to be quantified] ) Chosen option approach Make use of overloading Open Policy Agent\u0026rsquo;s input along with an external storage source (instead of an OPA service) in conjunction with go-micro\u0026rsquo;s gRPC client wrappers (a.k.a. middlewares) to leverage policy rules evaluation.\nTerminology New terms are defined to refer to new mental models:\nPolicy: self-imposed limitation of a piece of software. i.e: \u0026ldquo;after 20 users limit the use of thumbnails\u0026rdquo;. Checkers: in the context of a middleware, a checker is in charge of defining logical conditions that prevent requests (users) from doing an action. Policy file: a rego file. Policy evaluation: the act of piecing together input (from a request), data (from an external storage) and policies in order to make a decision. Temporary new Interfaces part of the PoC IStorage: provides means of extracting data from an external source (in case of the POC an etcd storage cluster). External data storages However, for this to be usable it needs state. The Rego engine works with input and data, where data is essentially a database the input is tried against, in order to expand this poc to include functionality such as counters (i.e: give access to the thumbnails only to 50 users) we need an external storage, and consequentially, Rego needs to have an option to load data from an external storage. There is an entire chapter in the documentation regarding external data: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/external-data/. The most \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; option (option 5) states:\nOPA includes functionality for reaching out to external servers during evaluation. This functionality handles those cases where there is too much data to synchronize into OPA, JWTs are ineffective, or policy requires information that must be as up-to-date as possible.\nThis is a natural option because it requires service-to-service communication, and by definition using microservices it should come \u0026ldquo;natural to us\u0026rdquo;. Another approach is using JWT (which we already use) to encode the necessary data into the JWT and handing it over to rego as \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo;. The issue with this approach is that depending on the features of the licenses the JWT might grow and be filled with noise and redundancy (this is, unless a new token is issued for licensing purposes).\nFuture ideas This proof of concept is very rigid in the sense that the IStorage interface only has one implementation that ties it to etcd, meaning running an oCIS cluster without an etcd service will result in a crash. This is by far ideal and less coupled implementations should be done. There is the case of using the storage metadata as a source to store data necessary to the policies, or even using the go-micro store as a kv store to achieve the exact same, since it already runs as its own service. The implementation of this is trivial and left out of the POC since it requires more time than the allotted for this task.\nMessage Broker This problem perfectly encompasses the use of a message broker, where services such as OCS will emit messages to a bus and only listeners react to them. In this case the following applies:\nThe necessary interfaces are provided to us by go-micro, only implementations are to be done.\n","description":"Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @hodyroff, @pmaier1, @fschade Date: 2021-06-30 Context and Problem Statement There should be a way to impose certain limitations in areas of the code that require licensing.

After reading this guide, you also should know everything needed to integrate oCIS into your existing monitoring and tracing infrastructure.\nOverview about the proposed solution Monitoring \u0026amp; tracing clients We assume that you already have oCIS deployed on one or multiple servers by using our deployment examples (see rectangle on the left). On these servers our monitoring \u0026amp; tracing clients, namely Telegraf and Jaeger agent, need to be added.\nTelegraf will collect host metrics (CPU, RAM, network, processes, \u0026hellip;) and docker metrics (per container CPU, RAM, network, \u0026hellip;). Telegraf is also configured to scrape metrics from Prometheus metric endpoints which oCIS exposes, this is done by the Prometheus input plugin . The metrics from oCIS and all other metrics gathered will be exposed with the Prometheus output plugin and can therefore be scraped by our monitoring \u0026amp; tracing server.\nJaeger agent is being configured as target for traces in oCIS. It then will receive traces from all oCIS services, add some process tags to them and forward them to our Jaeger collector on our monitoring \u0026amp; tracing server.\nFor more information and how to deploy it, see monitoring \u0026amp; tracing client.\nMonitoring \u0026amp; tracing server A live version of the monitoring and tracing server for our demo instances is available here: Grafana, Prometheus and Jaeger Query.\nThe monitoring \u0026amp; tracing server is considered as shared infrastructure and is normally used for different services. This means that oCIS is not the only software whose metrics and traces are available on the monitoring server. It is also possible that data of multiple oCIS instances are available on the monitoring server.\nMetrics are scraped, stored and can be queried with Prometheus. For the visualization of these metrics Grafana is used. Because Prometheus is scraping the metrics from the oCIS server (pull model instead of a push model), the Prometheus server must have access to the exposed endpoint of the Telegraf Prometheus output plugin.\nJaeger collector receives traces sent by the Jaeger agent on the oCIS servers and persists them in ElasticSearch. From there the user can query and visualize the traces in Jaeger query or in Grafana. Because Jaeger agent is actively sending traces to the monitoring \u0026amp; tracing server, the server must be reachable from the oCIS server.\nFor more information and how to deploy it, see monitoring \u0026amp; tracing server.\n","description":"Overview about the proposed solution Monitoring \u0026amp; tracing clients Monitoring \u0026amp; tracing server Monitoring and tracing gives developers and admin insights into a complex system, in this case oCIS.\nIf you are a developer and want to trace during developing you should have a look at example server setup.\nThis documentation describes how to set up a long-running monitoring \u0026amp; tracing infrastructure for one or multiple oCIS servers or deployments."},{"id":34,"href":"/services/app-registry/apps/","title":"Apps","parent":"App-Registry","content":"oCIS is all about files. But most of the time you want to do something with files that is beyond the basic upload, download and share behavior. Therefore, oCIS has a concept for apps, that can handle specific file types, so-called mime types.\nApp provider capability The capabilities endpoint (e.g. https://localhost:9200/ocs/v1.php/cloud/capabilities?format=json) gives you following capabilities which are relevant for the app provider:\n{ \u0026#34;ocs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;files\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;app_providers\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apps_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/app/list\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;open_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/app/open\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;open_web_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/app/open-with-web\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;new_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/app/new\u0026#34; } ] } } } } } Please note that there might be two or more app providers with different versions. This is not be expected to happen on a regular basis. It was designed for a possible migration period for clients when the app provider needs a breaking change. App registry The app registry is the single point where all apps register themselves and their respective supported mime types.\nMime type configuration / creation allow list The apps will register their supported mime types automatically, so that users can open supported files with them.\nAdministrators can set default applications on a per mime type basis and also allow the creation of new files for certain mime types. This per mime type configuration also features a description, file extension option and an icon.\nIn order to modify the mime type config you need to set STORAGE_APP_REGISTRY_MIMETYPES_JSON=.../mimetypes.json to a valid JSON file with content like this:\n[ { \u0026#34;mime_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extension\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;odt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpenDocument\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpenDocument text document\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://some-website.test/opendocument-text-icon.png\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;default_app\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Collabora\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allow_creation\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;mime_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extension\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ods\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpenSpreadsheet\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpenDocument spreadsheet document\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;default_app\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Collabora\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allow_creation\u0026#34;: false } ] Fields:\nmime_type is the mime type you want to configure extension is the file extension to be used for new files name is the name of the file / mime type description is a human-readable description of the file / mime type icon URL to an icon which should be used for that mime type default_app name of the default app which opens this mime type when the user doesn\u0026rsquo;t specify one allow_creation is whether a user should be able to create new file from that mime type (true or false) Listing available apps / mime types Clients, for example ownCloud Web, need to offer users the available apps to open files and mime types for new file creation.

Feel free to check out [his changes](https://github.com/egoist/rollup-plugin-postcss/pull/384) and build them locally if you absolutely want to work on Windows. After cloning the source code, install the dependencies via pnpm install and bundle the frontend code by running pnpm build:w.\nThen, you can start the server by running docker-compose up ocis and access it via https://host.docker.internal:9200. If you\u0026rsquo;re not using Docker Desktop, you might have to modify your /etc/hosts and add 127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal to make the host.docker.internal links work.\nThe bundled frontend code automatically gets mounted into the Docker containers, recompiles on changes and you can log in using the demo user (admin/admin) and take a look around!\nFor more details on how to set up Web for development, please see tooling.\nSource Code The source code is hosted at https://github.com/owncloud/web. Please refer to the build documentation for Web.\nConfiguration Depending on the backend you are using, there are sample config files provided in the config folder of the ownCloud Web git repository. See below for available backends. Also, find some of the configuration details below.\ncustomTranslations You can specify one or multiple files to overwrite existing translations. For example set this option to [{url: \u0026quot;https://localhost:9200/customTranslations.json\u0026quot;}]. Options options.homeFolder You can specify a folder that is used when the user navigates home. Navigating home gets triggered by clicking on the All files menu item. The user will not be jailed in that directory. It simply serves as a default location. You can either provide a static location, or you can use variables of the user object to come up with a user specific home path. This uses twig template variable style and allows you to pick a value or a substring of a value of the authenticated user. Examples are /Shares, /{{.Id}} and /{{substr 0 3 .Id}}/{{.Id}. options.openAppsInTab Configures whether apps and extensions generally should open in a new tab. Defaults to false. options.disablePreviews Set this option to true to disable previews in all the different file listing views. The only list view that is not affected by this is the trash bin, as that doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow showing previews at all. options.previewFileMimeTypes Specifies which mimeTypes will be previewed in the ui. For example to only preview jpg and text files set this option to [\u0026quot;image/jpeg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;text/plain\u0026quot;]. options.accountEditLink This accepts an object with the following optional fields to have a link on the account page: options.accountEditLink.href Set a different target URL for the edit link. Make sure to prepend it with http(s)://. options.disableFeedbackLink Set this option to true to disable the feedback link in the topbar. Keeping it enabled (value false or absence of the option) allows ownCloud to get feedback from your user base through a dedicated survey website. options.feedbackLink This accepts an object with the following optional fields to customize the feedback link in the topbar: options.feedbackLink.href Set a different target URL for the feedback link. Make sure to prepend it with http(s)://. Defaults to https://owncloud.com/web-design-feedback. options.feedbackLink.ariaLabel Since the link only has an icon, you can set an e.g. screen reader accessible label. Defaults to ownCloud feedback survey. options.feedbackLink.description Provide any description you want to see as tooltip and as accessible description. Defaults to Provide your feedback: We'd like to improve the web design and would be happy to hear your feedback. Thank you! Your ownCloud team. options.sharingRecipientsPerPage Sets the amount of users shown as recipients in the dropdown when sharing resources. Default amount is 200. options.sidebar.shares.showAllOnLoad Sets the list of (link) shares list in the sidebar to be initially expanded (default is a collapsed state, only showing the first three shares). options.runningOnEos Set this option to true if running on an EOS storage backend to enable its specific features. Defaults to false, and we recommend reaching out to the ownCloud web team if you\u0026rsquo;re not CERN and thinking about enabling this feature flag. options.cernFeatures Enabling this will activate CERN-specific features. Defaults to false. options.hoverableQuickActions Set this option to true to hide the quick actions (buttons appearing on file rows), and only show them when the user hovers the row with his mouse. Defaults to false. option.routing This accepts an object with the following fields to customize the routing behaviour: options.routing.idBased Enable or disable fileIds being added to the URL. Defaults to true because otherwise e.g. spaces with name clashes can\u0026rsquo;t be resolved correctly. Only disable this if you can guarantee server side that spaces of the same namespace can\u0026rsquo;t have name clashes. options.upload.xhr.timeout Specifies the timeout for XHR uploads in milliseconds. options.editor.autosaveEnabled Specifies if the autosave for the editor apps is enabled. options.editor.autosaveInterval Specifies the time interval for the autosave of editor apps in seconds. options.editor.openAsPreview Specifies if non-personal files i.e. files in shares, spaces or public links are being opened in read only mode so the user needs to manually switch to edit mode. Can be set to true, false or an array of web app/editor names. options.contextHelpersReadMore Specifies whether the \u0026ldquo;Read more\u0026rdquo; link should be displayed or not. options.openLinksWithDefaultApp Specifies whether single file link shares should be opened with default app or not. options.tokenStorageLocal Specifies whether the access token will be stored in the local storage when set to true or in the session storage when set to false. If stored in the local storage, login state will be persisted across multiple browser tabs, means no additional logins are required. Defaults to true. options.loginUrl Specifies the target URL to the login page. This is helpful when an external IdP is used. This option is disabled by default. Example URL like: \u0026lsquo;https://www.myidp.com/login'. options.logoutUrl Adds a link to the user\u0026rsquo;s profile page to point him to an external page, where he can manage his session and devices. This is helpful when an external IdP is used. This option is disabled by default. options.ocm.openRemotely Specifies whether opening files in remote shares in their original ocm instance should be enabled. Defaults to false. options.userListRequiresFilter Defines whether one or more filters must be set in order to list users in the Web admin settings. Set this option to \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; if running in an environment with a lot of users and listing all users could slow down performance. Defaults to false. options.concurrentRequests This accepts an object with the following optional fields to customize the maximum number of concurrent requests in code paths where we limit concurrent requests resourceBatchActions Concurrent number of file/folder/space batch actions like e.g. accepting shares. Defaults to 4. sse Concurrent number of SSE event handlers. Defaults to 4. shares Accepts an object regarding the following sharing related options: create Concurrent number of share invites. Defaults to 4. list Concurrent number of individually loaded shares. Defaults to 2. Scripts and Styles Web supports adding additional CSS and JavaScript files to further customize the user experience and adapt it to your specific needs. Please consider opening a feature request if you feel like your customization could be a benefit to the upstream project, and keep an eye open for future major releases of web since this API may change.\nstyles expects an array of objects that specify a href attribute, pointing to the path/URL of your stylesheet, like [{ \u0026quot;href\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;css/custom.css\u0026quot; }]. scripts expects an array of objects that specify a src attribute, pointing to the path/URL of your script, and an optional async attribute (defaults to false), like [{ \u0026quot;src\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;js/custom.js\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;async\u0026quot;: true }]. Sentry Web supports Sentry to provide monitoring and error tracking. To enable sending data to a Sentry instance, you can use the following configuration keys:\nsentry.dsn Should contain the DSN for your sentry project. sentry.environment: Lets you specify the environment to use in Sentry. Defaults to production. Any other key under sentry will be forwarded to the Sentry initialization. You can find out more settings in the Sentry docs.\nIf you are using an old version of Sentry (9 and before), you might want to add the setting sentry.autoSessionTracking: false to avoid errors related to breaking changes introduced in the integration libraries.

WebUI URL format","parent":"Architecture Decisions","content":" Status: accepted Deciders: @refs, @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @hodyroff, @pmaier1, @fschade, @tbsbdr, @kulmann Date: 2021-07-07 Context and Problem Statement When speaking about URLs we have to make a difference between browser URLs and API URLs. Only browser URLs are visible to end users and will be bookmarked. The currently existing and bookmarked ownCloud 10 URLs look something like this:\nGET https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource\u0026amp;fileid=5472225 303 Location: https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource When the URL contains a fileid parameter the server will look up the corresponding dir, overwriting whatever was set before the redirect. The fileid always takes precedence and the server is responsible for the lookup.\nGET https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource The dir parameter is then used to make a WebDAV request against the /dav/files endpoint of the currently logged-in user:\nPROPFIND https://demo.owncloud.com/remote.php/dav/files/demo/path/to/resource The resulting PROPFIND response is used to render the file listing. All good so far.\nFor the new ocis web UI we want to clean up the user visible Browser URLs. They currently look like this:\nhttps://demo.owncloud.com/#/files/list/all/path/to/resource Currently, there is no fileid like parameter in the browser URL, making bookmarks of it fragile (they break when a bookmarked folder is renamed).\nThe oCIS web UI just takes the path and uses the /webdav endpoint of the currently logged-in user:\nPROPFIND https://demo.owncloud.com/remote.php/webdav/path/to/resource With the new ownCloud web client (owncloud/web)\nneeds to interpret them to make API calls. With this in mind, this is the current mapping on ownCloud Web with OC10 and OCIS backend:\nBrowser URL API URL OC10 + classic WebUI https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource\u0026amp;fileid=5472225 https://demo.owncloud.com/remote.php/dav/files/demo/path/to/resource OC10 + OCIS WebUI https://web.owncloud.com/index.html#/files/list/all/path%2Fto%2Fresource https://demo.owncloud.com/remote.php/webdav/path/to/resource OCIS https://demo.owncloud.com/#/files/list/all/path/to/resource https://demo.owncloud.com/remote.php/webdav/path/to/resource On an OC10 backend the fileid query parameter takes precedence over the dir. In fact if dir is invalid but fileid isn\u0026rsquo;t, the resolution will succeed, as opposed to if the fileid is wrong (doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist) and dir correct, resolution will fail altogether with a 404.\nThis ADR is limited to the scope of \u0026ldquo;how will a web client deal with the browser URL?\u0026rdquo;. The API URLs will change with the spaces concept to https://demo.owncloud.com/dav/spaces/\u0026lt;space_id\u0026gt;/relative/path/to/resource. The Web UI can look up a space id and the mount path using the /graph/v1.0/drives API:\nTODO for a given resource id as part of the URL the https://demo.owncloud.com/v1.0/drive/items/123456A14B0A7750!359?$select=parentReference can be used to retrieve the drive/space: { \u0026#34;parentReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;driveId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123456a14b0a7750\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;driveType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;personal\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123456A14B0A7750!357\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/drive/root:\u0026#34; } } TODO to fetch the list of all spaces with their mount points we need an API endpoint that allows clients (not only the web ui) to \u0026lsquo;sync\u0026rsquo; the list of storages a user has access to from the storage registry on the server side. This allows clients to directly talk to a storage provider on another instance, allowing true storage federation. The MS graph api has no notion of mount points, so we will need to add a mountpath (or mountpoint? or alias?) to our drive resource properties in the libreGraph spec. Tracked in https://github.com/owncloud/open-graph-api/issues/6 @jfd: The graph api returns a path in the parentReference, which is part of the root in a drive resource. But it contains a value in the namespace of the graph endpoint, e.g.: /drive/root:/Bilder for the /Bilder folder in the root of the currently logged-in users personal drive/space. Which is again relative to the drive. To give the clients a way to determine the mount point we need to add a new mountpath/point/alias property. Decision Drivers To reveal relevant context to the user URLs should either carry a path component or a meaningful alias To prevent bookmarks from breaking URLs should have an id component that can be used by the system to lookup the resource Considered Options Existing ownCloud 10 URLs ID based URLs Path based URLs Space based URLs Mixed Global URLs Configurable path component in URLs Decision Outcome Chosen option: \u0026ldquo;Mixed global URLs\u0026rdquo;, because it meets the requirement to contain a path and a stable identifier.\nPositive Consequences The path makes it \u0026ldquo;human readable\u0026rdquo; The URL can be bookmarked The bookmarked URLs remain stable even if the path changes All URLs can be shortened to hide any metadata like path, resource name and query parameters Negative Consequences the web UI needs to look up the space alias in a registry to build an API request for the /dav/space endpoint Pros and Cons of the Options Existing OwnCloud 10 URLs The existing ownCloud 10 URLs look like this\nURL comment https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/apps/files/?dir=\u0026lt;path\u0026gt;\u0026amp;fileid=\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; pattern https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/\u0026amp;fileid=18 root of the currently logged in user https://demo.owncloud.com/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource\u0026amp;fileid=192 sub folder /path/to/resource It contains a path and a fileid (which takes precedence).\nGood, because the fileid prevents bookmarks from breaking Good, because the dir reveals context in the form of a path Bad, because the web UI needs to look up the space alias in a registry to build an API request for the /dav/space endpoint Bad, because URLs still contain a long prefix (/index.php)/apps/files Bad, because the fileid needs to be accompanied by a storageid to allow efficient routing in ocis Bad, because if not configured properly an additional /index.php prefixes the route Bad, because power users cannot navigate by updating only the path in the URL, as the fileid takes precedence.

The fileid is a URL encoded \u0026lt;cid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;numericid\u0026gt;. Very similar to the CS3 resourceid which consists of storageid and nodeid.\nGood, because bookmarks cannot break Good, because URLs do not disclose unshared path segments Bad, because the web UI needs to look up the space id in a registry to build an API request for the /dav/space endpoint Bad, because URLs reveal no context to users Path based URLs There is a customized ownCloud instance that uses path only based URLs:\nURL comment https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/apps/files/?dir=/\u0026amp; root of the currently logged in user https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/\u0026amp; root of the currently logged in user https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource\u0026amp; sub folder /path/to/resource Good, because the URLs reveal the full path context to users Good, because power users can navigate by updating the path in the url Bad, because the web UI needs to look up the space id in a registry to build an API request for the /dav/space endpoint Bad, because the bookmarks break when someone renames a folder in the path Bad, because there is no id that can be used as a fallback lookup mechanism Bad, because URLs might leak too much context (parent folders of shared files) Space based URLs URL comment https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/#/s/\u0026lt;space_id\u0026gt;(/\u0026lt;relative/path\u0026gt;)(?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt;) the pattern, relative path and resource_id are optional https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607 root of a storage space, might be the currently logged in users home https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607/relative/path/to/resource sub folder /relative/path/to/resource in the storage with id b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607, works only if path still exists https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607/relative/path/to/resource?id=ba4c1820-df12-11eb-8dcd-ff21f12c1264:beb78dd6-df12-11eb-a05c-a395505126f6 sub folder /relative/path/to/resource in the storage with id b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607, lookup can fall back to the id /# is used by the current vue router. /s denotes that this is a space url. \u0026lt;space_id\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; both consist of \u0026lt;storage_id\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;node_id\u0026gt;, but the space_id can be replaced with a shorter id or an alias. See further down below. \u0026lt;relative/path\u0026gt; takes precedence over the \u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt;, both are optional Good, because the web UI does not need to look up the space id in a registry to build an API request for the /dav/space endpoint Good, because the URLs reveal a relevant path context to users Good, because everything after the # is not sent to the server, building the webdav request to list the folder is offloaded to the clients Good, because power users can navigate by updating the path in the url Bad, because the current ids are uuid based, leading to very long URLs where the path component nearly vanishes between two very long strings Bad, because the # in the URL is just a technical requirement Bad, because ocis web requires a /#/files/s at the root of the route to distinguish the files app from other apps Bad, while navigating using the WebUI, the URL has to be updated whenever we change spaces. Bad, because the technical \u0026lt;space_id\u0026gt; is meaningless to end users With the above explained, let\u0026rsquo;s see some use cases:\nExample 1: UserA shares something from her Home folder with UserB open the browser and go to demo.owncloud.com the browser\u0026rsquo;s url changes to: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607. You\u0026rsquo;re now in YOUR home folder / personal space. you create a new folder /relative/path/to/resource and navigate into /relative/path/to the URL now changes to: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607/relative/path/to You share resource with some else You navigate into /relative/path/to/resource now the URL would look like: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:3a9305da-df17-11eb-ab99-abe09d93e08a As you can see, even if you\u0026rsquo;re the owner of /relative/path/to/resource and navigate into it, the URL changes due to a new space being entered. This ensures that while working in your home folder, copying URLs and giving them to the person you share the resource with, the receiver can still navigate within the new space.\nIn short terms, while navigating using the WebUI, the URL has to constantly change whenever we change spaces to reflect the most explicit one.\nExample 2: UserA shares something from a Workspace Assuming we only have one storage provider; a consequence of this, all storage spaces will start with the same storage_id.\nopen the browser and go to demo.owncloud.com the browser\u0026rsquo;s url changes to: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607. You\u0026rsquo;re now in YOUR home folder / personal space. you have access to a workspace called foo (created by an admin) navigate into workspace foo the URL now changes to: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:d342f9ce-df18-11eb-b319-1b6d9df4bc74. You are now at the root of the workspace foo. because we only have one storage provider, the space_id section of the URL only updates the node_id part of it. had we had more than one storage provider, the space_id would depend on which storage provider contains the storage space. you create a folder /relative/path/to/resource you navigate into /relative/path/to/resource now the URL would look like: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:d342f9ce-df18-11eb-b319-1b6d9df4bc74/relative/path/to/resource or a more robust url: https://demo.owncloud.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:d342f9ce-df18-11eb-b319-1b6d9df4bc74/relative/path/to/resource?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:04f1991c-df19-11eb-9cc7-3b09f04f9ca3 Spaces Registry A big drawback against this idea is that the length of the URL is increased by a lot, rendering them almost unreadable. Introducing a Spaces Registry (SR) would shorten them. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how.\nA URL without a SR would look like: https://ocis.com/#/s/b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:d342f9ce-df18-11eb-b319-1b6d9df4bc74/TEST?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:04f1991c-df19-11eb-9cc7-3b09f04f9ca3 The same URL with a SR https://ocis.com/#/s/workspaceFoo/TEST?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:04f1991c-df19-11eb-9cc7-3b09f04f9ca3\nSpace Registry resolution can happen at the client side (i.e: the client keeps a list of space name -\u0026gt; space id [where space id = storageid + nodeid]; the client queries a SR) or server side. Server side is more resilient due to clients can have limited networking; for instance if they are running on a tight intranet.\nMixed Global URLs While ID based space URLs can be made more readable by shortening the IDs they only start to reveal context when an alias is used instead of the space id. These aliases however have to be unique identifiers. These aliases should live in namespaces like /workspaces/marketing and /personal/marketing to make phishing attacks harder (in this case a user that registered with the username marketing). But namespaced aliases is semantically equivalent to \u0026hellip; a path hierarchy.\nWhen every space has a namespaced alias and a relative path we can build a global namespace:\nURL comment https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/files\u0026lt;/namespaced/alias\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/relative/path/to/resource\u0026gt;?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; the pattern, /files might become optional https://demo.owncloud.com/files/personal/einstein/?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21607 root of user einstein https://demo.owncloud.com/files/personal/einstein/relative/path/to/resource?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21608 sub folder /relative/path/to/resource https://demo.owncloud.com/files/shares/einstein/somesharename?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21608 shared URL for /relative/path/to/resource https://demo.owncloud.com/files/personal/einstein/marie is stupid/and richard as well/resource?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21608 sub folder marie is stupid/and richard as well/resource \u0026hellip; something einstein might not want to reveal https://demo.owncloud.com/files/shares/einstein/resource (2)?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21608 named link URL for /marie is stupid/and richard as well/resource, does not disclose the actual hierarchy, has an appended counter to avoid a collision https://demo.owncloud.com/files/shares/einstein/mybestfriends?id=b78c2044-5b51-446f-82f6-907a664d089c:194b4a97-597c-4461-ab56-afd4f5a21608 named link URL for /marie is stupid/and richard as well/resource, does not disclose the actual hierarchy, has a custom alias for the share https://demo.owncloud.com/files/public/kcZVYaXr7oZ66bg/relative/path/to/resource sub folder /relative/path/to/resource in public link with token kcZVYaXr7oZ66bg https://demo.owncloud.com/files/public/kcZVYaXr7oZ66bg/relative/path/to/resource sub folder /relative/path/to/resource in public link with token kcZVYaXr7oZ66bg https://demo.owncloud.com/s/kcZVYaXr7oZ66bg/ shortened link to a resource. This is needed to be able to copy a link to a resource without leaking any metadata. \u0026lt;/namespaced/alias\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/relative/path/to/resource\u0026gt; is the global path in the CS3 api. The CS3 Storage Registry is responsible by managing the mount points.\nIn order to be able to copy and paste URLs all resources must be uniquely identifiable:\nInstead of /home the URL always has to reflect the user: /personal/einstein Workspaces can use /workspaces/\u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; or /workspaces/\u0026lt;additional\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;classification\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; where the hierarchy is given by the organization Experiments can use /experiments/\u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; Research institutes could set up /papers/\u0026lt;researchgroup\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; Trash could be accessed by prefixing the namespace alias with /trash? or using /trash/\u0026lt;space_id\u0026gt; Instead of a namespaced alias a storage space id could be used with a generic /space/\u0026lt;space_id\u0026gt; namespace An url shortener can create urls like /s/\u0026lt;token\u0026gt; which could be used as a stable link to a resource. Links for anonymous users will resolve to /public/\u0026lt;token\u0026gt; The alias namespace hierarchy and depth can be pre-determined by the admin. Even if aliases change the id parameter prevents bookmarks from breaking. A user can decide to build a different hierarchy by using his own registry.\nWhat about shares? Similar to /home it must reflect the user: /shares/einstein would list all shares by einstein for the currently logged-in user. The ui needs to apply the same URL rewriting as for space based URLs: when navigating into a share the URL has to switch from /personal/einstein/relative/path/to/shared/resource to /shares/einstein/\u0026lt;unique and potentially namespaced alias for shared resource\u0026gt;. When more than one resource was shared a name collision would occur. To prevent this we can use ids /shares/einstein/id/\u0026lt;resource_id or namespaced aliases /shares/einstein/files/alias. Similar to the /trash prefix we could treat /shares as a filter for the shared resources a user has access to, but that would disclose unshared path segments in personal spaces. We could make that a feature and let users create an alias for a shared resource, similar as for public links. Then they can decide if they want to disclose the full path in their personal space (or another workspace) or if they want to use an alias which is then accessed at /shares/einstein/\u0026lt;alias\u0026gt;. As a default we could take the alias at creation time from the filename. That way two shares to a resource with the same name, e.g.: /personal/einstein/project AAA/foo and /personal/einstein/project BBB/foo would lead to /shares/einstein/foo (a CS3 internal reference to /personal/einstein/project AAA/foo) and /shares/einstein/foo (2) (a CS3 internal reference to /personal/einstein/project BBB/foo). foo (2) would keep its name even when foo is deleted or renamed. Well an id as the alias might be better then, because users might rename these aliases, which would break URLs if they have been bookmarked. In any case this would make end user more aware of what they share AND it would allow them to choose an arbitrary context for the links they want to send out: personal internal share URLs.\nWith these different namespaces the /files part in the URL becomes obsolete, because the files application can be registered for multiple namespaces: /personal, /workspaces, /shares, /trash \u0026hellip;\nGood, because it contains a global path Good, because spaces with namespaced aliases can be bookmarked and copied into mails or chat without disclosing unshared path segments, as the space is supposed to be shared Good, because the UI can detect broken paths and notify the user to update his bookmark if the resource could be found by id Good, because the /files part might only be required for id only based lookup to let the web ui know which app is responsible for the route Good, because it turns shares into deliberately named spaces in /shares/\u0026lt;owner\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;alias\u0026gt; Good, because all urls can be shortened to hide any metadata like path, resource name and query parameters Bad, because the web UI needs to look up the space alias in a registry to build an API request for the /dav/space endpoint Configurable path component in URLs Not every deployment may have the requirement to have the path in the URL. We could use id only based URLs, similar to onedrive and make showing paths configurable.\nURL comment https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/files?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; default id based navigation https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/files\u0026lt;/namespaced/alias\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/relative/path/to/resource\u0026gt;?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; optional path based navigation with fallback to id In contrast to ownCloud 10 path takes precedence and the user is warned when the fileid in his bookmark no longer matches the id on the server: sth. like \u0026ldquo;The path of the resource has changed, please verify and update your bookmark!\u0026rdquo;\nWhen a file is selected the filename also becomes part of the URL so individual files can be bookmarked.\nIf navigation is id based we need to look up the path for the id so we can make a webdav request, or we need to implement the graph drives and driveItem resources.\nThe URL https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/files?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt;̀ is sent to the server. It has to look up the correct path and redirect the request, including the path. But that would make all bookmarks contain tha path again, even if paths were configured to not be part of the URL.\nThe /meta/\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; webdav endpoint can be used to look up the path with property meta-path-for-user.\nFor now, we would use path based navigation with URLs like this:\nhttps://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/files\u0026lt;/namespaced/alias\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/relative/path/to/resource\u0026gt;?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; This means that only the resource path is part of the URL path. Any other parameter, e.g. file id, page or sort order must be given as URL parameters.\nTo make lookup by id possible we need to implement the /meta/\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; endpoint so the sdk can use it to look up the path. We should not implement a redirect on the ocis server side because the same redirect logic would need to be added to oc10. Having it in ocis web is the right place.\nThe old sharing links and oc10 urls still need to be redirected by ocis/reva as in oc10.\nPublic links would have the same format: https://\u0026lt;host\u0026gt;/files?id=\u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; The web UI has to detect if the user is logged in or not and adjust the ui accordingly.\nSince there is no difference between public and private files a logged-in user cannot see the public version of a link unless he logs out.

The driver can be used to change the implementation of a storage aspect to better reflect the actual underlying storage capabilities. As an example a move operation on a POSIX filesystem (theoretically) is an atomic operation. When trying to implement a file tree on top of S3 there is no native move operation that can be used. A naive implementation might fall back on a COPY and DELETE. Some S3 implementations provide a COPY operation that uses an existing key as the source, so the file at least does not need to be reuploaded. In the worst case scenario, which is renaming a folder with hundreds of thousands of objects, a reupload for every file has to be made. Instead of hiding this complexity a better choice might be to disable renaming of files or at least folders on S3. There are however implementations of filesystems on top of S3 that store the tree metadata in dedicated objects or use a completely different persistence mechanism like a distributed key value store to implement the file tree aspect of a storage.\nWhile the storage provider is responsible for managing the tree, file up- and downloads are delegated to a dedicated data provider. See below. Storage aspects A lot of different storage technologies exist, ranging from general purpose file systems with POSIX semantics to software defined storage with multiple APIs. Choosing any of them is making a tradeoff decision. Or, if a storage technology is already in place it automatically predetermines the capabilities that can be made available. Not all storage systems are created equal.\nUnfortunately, no POSIX filesystem natively supports all storage aspects that ownCloud 10 requires:\nA hierarchical file tree An important aspect of a filesystem is organizing files and directories in a file hierarchy, or tree. It allows you to create, move and delete nodes. Beside the name a node also has well known metadata like size and mtime that are persisted in the tree as well.\nFolders are not directories There is a difference between folder and directory: a directory is a file system concept. A folder is a metaphor for the concept of a physical file folder. There are also virtual folders or smart folders like the recent files folder which are no file system directories. So, every directory and every virtual folder is a folder, but not every folder is a directory. See the folder metaphor in wikipedia. Also see the activity history below. Id based lookup While traditionally nodes in the tree are reached by traversing the path the tree persistence should be prepared to look up a node by an id. Think of an inode in a POSIX filesystem. If this operation needs to be cached for performance reasons keep in mind that cache invalidation is hard and crawling all files to update the inode to path mapping takes O(n), not O(1).\nETag propagation For the state based sync a client can discover changes by recursively descending the tree and comparing the ETag for every node. If the storage technology supports propagating ETag changes up the tree, only the root node of a tree needs to be checked to determine if a discovery needs to be started and which nodes need to be traversed. This allows using the storage technology itself to persist all metadata that is necessary for sync, without additional services or caches.\nSubtree size accounting The tree can keep track of how many bytes are stored in a folder. Similar to ETag propagation a change in file size is propagated up the hierarchy.\nETag and Size propagation When propagating the ETag (mtime) and size changes up the tree the question is where to stop. If all changes need to be propagated to the root of a storage then the root or busy folders will become a hotspot. There are two things to keep in mind: 1. propagation only happens up to the root of a single space (a user private drive or a single group drive), 2. no cross storage propagation. The latter was used in oc10 to let clients detect when a file in a received shared folder changed. This functionality is moving to the storage registry which caches the ETag for every root so clients can discover if and which storage changed. Rename Depending on the underlying storage technology some operations may either be slow, up to a point where it makes more sense to disable them entirely. One example is a folder rename: on S3 a simple folder rename translates to a copy and delete operation for every child of the renamed folder. There is an exception though: this restriction only applies if the S3 storage is treated like a filesystem, where the keys are the path and the value is the file content. There are smarter ways to implement file systems on top of S3, but again: there is always a tradeoff.\nS3 has no rename Technically, S3 has no rename operation at all. By design, the location of the value is determined by the key, so it always has to do a copy and delete. Another example is the redis RENAME operation: while being specified as O(1) it executes an implicit DEL operation, so if the deleted key contains a very big value it may cause high latency\u0026hellip; Arbitrary metadata persistence In addition to well known metadata like name size and mtime, users might be able to add arbitrary metadata like tags, comments or dublin core. In POSIX filesystems this maps to extended attributes.\nGrant persistence The CS3 API uses grants to describe access permissions. Storage systems have a wide range of permissions granularity and not all grants may be supported by every storage driver. POSIX ACLs for example have no expiry. If the storage system does not support certain grant properties, e.g. expiry, then the storage driver may choose to implement them in a different way. Expiries could be persisted in a different way and checked periodically to remove the grants. Again: every decision is a tradeoff.\nTrash persistence After deleting a node the storage allows listing the deleted nodes and has an undo mechanism for them.\nVersions persistence A user can restore a previous version of a file.\nSnapshots are not versions Modern POSIX filesystems support snapshotting of volumes. This is different from keeping track of versions to a file or folder, but might be another implementation strategy for a storage driver to allow users to restore content. Activity History The storage keeps an activity history, tracking the different actions that have been performed. This does not only include file changes but also metadata changes like renames and permission changes.\nStorage drivers Reva currently has several storage driver implementations that can be used for storage providers as well as data providers.\nOCIS and S3NG Storage Driver The oCIS storage driver is the default storage driver. It decomposes the metadata and persists it in a POSIX filesystem. Blobs are stored on the filesystem as well. The layout makes extensive use of symlinks and extended attributes. A filesystem like xfs or zfs without practical inode size limitations is recommended. We will evolve this to further integrate with file systems like cephfs or gpfs.\nExt4 limits the number of bytes that can be used for extended attribute names and their values to the size of a single block (by default 4k). This reduces the number of shares for a single file or folder to roughly 20-30, as grants have to share the available space with other metadata. The S3NG storage driver uses the same metadata layout on a POSIX storage as the oCIS driver, but it uses S3 as the blob storage.\nTradeoffs ➕ Efficient ID based lookup\n➕ Leverages Kernel VFS cache\n➕ No database needed\n➖ Not intended to be accessed by end users on the server side as it does not reflect a normal filesystem on disk\n➖ Metadata limited by Kernel VFS limits (see below)\nRelated Kernel limits The Decomposed FS currently stores CS3 grants in extended attributes. When listing extended attributes the result is currently limited to 64kB. Assuming a 20 byte uuid a grant has ~40 bytes. Which would limit the number of extended attributes to ~1630 entries or ~1600 shares. This can be extended by moving the grants from extended attributes into a dedicated file and is tracked in ocis/issues/4638.\nFrom Wikipedia on Extended file attributes:\nThe Linux kernel allows extended attribute to have names of up to 255 bytes and values of up to 64 KiB,[14] as do XFS and ReiserFS, but ext2/3/4 and btrfs impose much smaller limits, requiring all the attributes (names and values) of one file to fit in one \u0026ldquo;filesystem block\u0026rdquo; (usually 4 KiB). Per POSIX.1e,[citation needed] the names are required to start with one of security, system, trusted, and user plus a period. This defines the four namespaces of extended attributes.[15]\nAnd from the man page on listxattr:\nAs noted in xattr(7), the VFS imposes a limit of 64 kB on the size of the extended attribute name list returned by listxattr(7). If the total size of attribute names attached to a file exceeds this limit, it is no longer possible to retrieve the list of attribute names.\nLocal Storage Driver The minimal storage driver for a POSIX based filesystem. It literally supports none of the storage aspect other than basic file tree management. Sharing can - to a degree - be implemented using POSIX ACLs.\ntree provided by a POSIX filesystem inefficient path by id lookup, currently uses the file path as id, so ids are not stable can store a uuid in extended attributes and use a cache to look them up, similar to the ownCloud driver no native ETag propagation, five options are available: built in propagation (changes bypassing ocis are not picked up until a rescan) built in inotify (requires 48 bytes of RAM per file, needs to keep track of every file and folder) external inotify (same RAM requirement, but could be triggered by external tools, e.g. a workflow engine) kernel audit log (use the linux kernel audit to capture file events on the storage and offload them to a queue) fuse filesystem overlay no subtree accounting, same options as for ETag propagation efficient rename arbitrary metadata using extended attributes grant persistence using POSIX ACLs requires an LDAP server to make guest accounts available in the OS an existing LDAP could be used if guests ar provisioned in another way using extended attributes to implement expiry or sharing that does not require OS level integration fuse filesystem overlay no native trash could use The FreeDesktop.org Trash specification fuse filesystem overlay no native versions, multiple options possible git for folders rcs for single files rsnapshot for hourly / daily / weekly / monthly backups \u0026hellip; but this is not versioning as known from oc10 design new freedesktop spec, basically what is done in oc10 without the limitations or borrow ideas from the freedesktop trash spec fuse filesystem overlay To provide the other storage aspects we plan to implement a FUSE overlay filesystem which will add the different aspects on top of local filesystems like ext4, btrfs or xfs. It should work on NFSv4 as well, although NFSv4 supports RichACLs and we will explore how to leverage them to implement sharing at a future date. The idea is to use the storages native capabilities to deliver the best user experience. But again: that means making the right tradeoffs.\nEOS Storage Driver The CERN eos storage has evolved with ownCloud and natively supports id based lookup, ETag propagation, subtree size accounting, sharing, trash and versions. To use it you need to change the default configuration of the storage storage-home command (or have a look at the Makefile ̀ eos-start` target):\nexport STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_NAMESPACE=/eos export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_MASTER_URL=\u0026#34;root://eos-mgm1.eoscluster.cern.ch:1094\u0026#34; export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_ENABLE_HOME=true export STORAGE_DRIVER_EOS_LAYOUT=\u0026#34;dockertest/{{.Username}}\u0026#34; Running it locally also requires the eos and xrootd binaries. Running it using make eos-start will use CentOS based containers that already have the necessary packages installed.\nPull requests to add explicit storage storage-(s3|custom|...) commands with working defaults are welcome. S3 Storage Driver A naive driver that treats the keys in an S3 capable storage as / delimited path names. While it does not support MOVE or ETag propagation it can be used to read and write files. Better integration with native capabilities like versioning is possible but depends on the Use Case. Several storage solutions that provide an S3 interface also support some form of notifications that can be used to implement ETag propagation.\nData Providers Clients using the CS3 API use an InitiateFileDownload and InitiateUpload request at the storage gateway to obtain a URL endpoint that can be used to either GET the file content or upload content using the resumable tus.io protocol.\nThe data provider uses the same storage driver as the storage provider but can be scaled independently.\nThe dataprovider allows uploading the file to a quarantine area where further data analysis may happen before making the file accessible again. One use case for this is antivirus scanning for files coming from untrusted sources.\nFuture work FUSE overlay filesystem We are planning to further separate the concerns and use a local storage provider with a FUSE filesystem overlaying the actual POSIX storage that can be used to capture deletes and writes that might happen outside of ocis/reva.\nIt would allow us to extend the local storage driver with missing storage aspects while keeping a tree like filesystem that end users are used to see when sshing into the machine.\nUpload to Quarantine area Antivirus scanning of random files uploaded from untrusted sources and executing metadata extraction or thumbnail generation should happen in a sandboxed system to prevent malicious users from gaining any information about the system. By spawning a new container with access to only the uploaded data we can further limit the attack surface.\n","description":"A storage driver implements access to a storage system:\nIt maps the path and id based CS3 references to an appropriate storage system specific reference, e.g.:\neos file ids posix inodes or paths deconstructed filesystem nodes Storage providers To manage the file tree oCIS uses storage providers that are accessing the underlying storage using a storage driver.

Other solutions are hot right now, such as Kubernetes, but for a single deployment this entails orbital measures.\nDecision Drivers Start oCIS microservices with a single command (ocis server).

A service can send out events which are received by one or more other services. The receiving service can cause different kinds of actions based on the event by utilizing the information that the event carries.\nExample: Email Notification A simple example is the notification feature for oCIS: Users should receive an email when another user shares a file with them. The information, that the file was shared should go out as an event from a storage provider or share manager, carrying the information which file was shared to which receiver. A potential notification service that sends out the email listens to these kinds of events and sends the email out once on every received event of that specific type.\nDecision Drivers Events are supposed to decouple services and raise flexibility, also considering extensions that are not directly controlled by the ownCloud project. Events should bring flexibility in the implementation of sending and receiving services. Events should not obsolete other mechanisms to communicate, i.e. grpc calls. Sending an event has to be as little resource consuming for the sender as possible. Events are never user visible. Considered Options Lightweight Events with Event Queue and \u0026ldquo;At most once\u0026rdquo; QoS As 1., but with \u0026ldquo;At least once\u0026rdquo; QoS Options 1. Lightweight Events with Event Queue and \u0026ldquo;At most once\u0026rdquo; QoS Reva will get a messaging service that is available to all services within oCIS and Reva. It is considered as one of the mandatory services of the oCIS system. If the messaging backend is not running, neither Reva nor oCIS can be considered healthy and should shut down.\nAll oCIS- and Reva-services can connect to the messaging bus and send so-called events. The sender gets an immediate return if handing the event to the message bus was successful or not.\nThe sender can not make any assumptions when the message is delivered to any receiving service. Depending on the QoS model (as proposed as alternatives in this ADR) it might even be not guaranteed that the event is delivered at all. Also, the sender can not know if zero, one or many services are listening to that event.\nEvent Data Events are identified by their namespace and their respective name. The namespace is delimited by dots and starts with either \u0026ldquo;reva\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; or a future extension name. It is followed by the name of the sending service and an unique name of the event.\nExample: ocis.ocdav.delete - an event with that name sent out if an WebDAV DELETE request arrived in the oCDav service.\nAn event can carry a payload which is encoded as json object. (See for example NATS ). There are no pre-defined members in that object, it is fully up to the sender which data will be included in the payload. Receivers must be robust to deal with changes.\nQuality of Service Events are sent with \u0026ldquo;At most once\u0026rdquo; quality of service. That means, if a receiver is not present at the moment of publishing it might not receive the event. That requires that the sender and the receiver must have functionality to back up the situation that events were missed. That adds more state to the services because they always need to behave like a FISM. Given that the event queue can be considered the backbone of the system, it is unlikely that it is not running.\nTransactions The described way of inter service communication with events is not transactional. It is not supposed to be, but only provides a lightweight, loosely coupled way to \u0026ldquo;inform\u0026rdquo;.\nIf transactions are required, proper synchronous GRPC API calls should be used. Another way would be to build asynchronous flows with request- and reply events as in saga pattern. That is only recommended for special cases.\nPros Simple setup Flexible way of connecting services Stateless event queue \u0026ldquo;State of the art\u0026rdquo; pattern in microservices architectures Cons Over engineering: Can we do without an extra message queue component? Messages might get lost, so that eventual consistency is endangered A service needs to hold more state to ensure consistency Message queue needs to be implemented in Reva 2. Lightweight Events with Event Queue and \u0026ldquo;At-least once\u0026rdquo; QoS Exactly as described above, but with a higher service level quality.\nQuality of Service Events are sent with \u0026ldquo;At least once\u0026rdquo; quality of service. That means the events will remain in the queue until they are received by all receivers. This puts more responsibility on the event bus and adds state to the events. Given that the event queue can be considered the backbone of the system, it is required to be running.\nPros Better service level: Messages do not get lost Simplifies the design of the microservices because the events are \u0026ldquo;fire-and-forget\u0026rdquo; Events would be idempotent. If a service goes down the events will stay in the queue until they are consumed Cons Stateful event system with higher cost in terms of compute and storage The queue could become a bottleneck and needs to be scaled Decision Outcome Design ","description":"Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @c0rby, @wkloucek Date: 2022-01-21 Context and Problem Statement Overview To be able to implement simple, flexible and independent inter service communication there is the idea to implement an event system in oCIS.

CernBox has been exposing a global namespace on /webdav for years already. The ocs service returns urls that are relative to the CS3 global namespace which makes both scenarios work, but only one of them at a time. Which is why the testsuite hiccups when trying to Allow full paths targets in reva#1605. In the global CS3 namespaces we plan to move /home/Shares, which currently lists all mounted shares of the currently logged-in user to a dedicated /shares namespace. See below and Move shares folder out from home directory to a separate mount reva#1584. ownCloud namespaces In contrast to the global namespace of CS3, ownCloud always presented a user specific namespace on all endpoints. It will always list the users private files under /. Shares can be mounted at an arbitrary location in the users private spaces. See the webdav and ocs sections for more details end examples.\nWith the spaces concept we are planning to introduce a global namespace to the ownCloud webdav endpoints. This will push the users private space down in the hierarchy: it will move from /webdav to /webdav/home or /webdav/users/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;. The related migration stages are subject to change.\nCS3 global namespaces The CS3 global namespace in oCIS is configured in the storage spaces registry. oCIS uses these defaults:\nglobal namespace description /home an alias for the currently logged in uses private space /users/\u0026lt;user_layout\u0026gt; user private spaces /shares a virtual listing of share spaces a user has access to /public/\u0026lt;token\u0026gt; a virtual folder listing public shares /spaces/\u0026lt;spacename\u0026gt; TODO: project or group spaces Technically, the /home namespace is not necessary: the storage spaces registry knows the path to a users private space in the /users namespace and the gateway can forward the requests to the responsible storage provider.\n*@jfd: Why don\u0026rsquo;t we use /home/\u0026lt;user_layout\u0026gt; instead of /users/\u0026lt;user_layout\u0026gt;. Then the paths would be consistent with most unix systems. The /shares namespace is used to solve two problems:\nTo query all shares the current user has access to the share manager can be used to list the resource ids. While the shares can then be navigated by resource id, they will return the relative path in the actual storage provider, leaking parent folders of the shared resource. When accepting a remote share e.g., for OCM the resource does not exist on the local instance. They are made accessible in the global namespace under the /shares namespace. @jfd: Should we split /shares into /collaborations, /ocm and /links? We also have /public which uses token based authentication. They may have different latencies or polling strategies? Well, I guess we can cache them differently regardless of the mount point. Browser URLs vs API URLs In ownCloud 10 you can not only create public links but also private links. Both can be copy pasted into an email or chat to grant others access to a file. Most often though, end users will copy and paste the URL from their browsers location bar.\nURL description https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/Photos/Vacation\u0026fileid=24 The normal browser URL https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?fileid=24 the dir is actually not used to find the directory and will be filled when pasting this URL https://demo.owncloud.com/f/24 private links are the shortened version of this and work in the same way https://demo.owncloud.com/s/piLdAAt1m3Bg0Fk public link The dir parameter alone cannot be used to look up the directory, because the path for a file may be different depending on the currently logged-in user:\nUser A shares his /path/to/Photos with User X. User B shares his /other/path/to/Photos with User X and Y. User A shares his /path/to/Photos with User Y. (Depending on the order in which they accept the shares) X and Y now have two folders /shares/Photos and /shares/Photos (1). But if they were to copy paste a link with that path in the URL and if the directory were only looked up by path X and Y would end up in different folders.\nYou could argue that the path should always use a global path in the CS3 namespace:\nUser A shares his /users/a/path/to/Photos with User X. User B shares his /users/b/other/path/to/Photos with User X and Y. User A shares his /users/a/path/to/Photos with User Y. By using a global path like this X and Y would always end up in the correct folder. However, there are two caveats:\nThis only works for resources that reside on the instance (because only they have unique and global path). Shares from other instances need to be identified by id, or they cannot be uniquely addressed User A may not want to leak path path/to segments leading to Photos. They might contain things like low-priority or personal data. That is the reason why URLs always have to contain some kind of stable identifier. By introducing the concept of storage spaces and treating user homes, project drives and shares we can create a URL that contains an identifier for the storage space and a path relative to the root of it.\nIn ocis we will unify the way links sharing works, however there will always be at least two types of URLs:\nthe URL you see in the browsers location bar, and the URL that a client uses to actually access a file.

There are 4 namespaces user, system, trusted and security. We can safely use the user namespace. An example attribute name would be user.ocis.owner.id. The linux kernel has length limits on attribute names and values.\nFrom Wikipedia on Extended file attributes:\nThe Linux kernel allows extended attribute to have names of up to 255 bytes and values of up to 64 KiB,[14] as do XFS and ReiserFS, but ext2/3/4 and btrfs impose much smaller limits, requiring all the attributes (names and values) of one file to fit in one “filesystem block” (usually 4 KiB). Per POSIX.1e,[citation needed] the names are required to start with one of security, system, trusted, and user plus a period. This defines the four namespaces of extended attributes.\nGood, because metadata is stored in the filesystem Good, because consistency is easy to maintain Good, because the data is attached to the file and survives file operations like copy and move Good, because a storage backup also covers the file metadata Bad, because we could hit the filesystem limit Bad, because changes to extended attributes are not atomic Metadata File We could store metadata in a metadata file next to the file content which has a structured content format like .json, .yaml or .toml. That would give us more space to store bigger amounts of metadata.\nGood, because there are no size limits Good, because there is more freedom to the content format Good, because a storage backup also covers the file metadata Bad, because it doubles the amount of read / write operations Bad, because it needs additional measures against concurrent overwriting changes Link metadata with an id in the extended attributes To link metadata to file content a single extended attribute with a file id (unique per storage space) is sufficient. This would also allow putting metadata in better suited storage systems like SQLite or a key value store.\nGood, because it avoids extended attribute limits Good, because the same mechanism could be used to look up files by id, when the underlying filesystem is an existing POSIX filesystem. Bad, because backup needs to cover the metadata as well. Could be mitigated by sharing metadata per space and doing space wide snapshots. Bad, because it is a bit more effort to access it to read or index it.

Usually oCIS will have no administrative access to such a system and we will not be allowed to reconfigure it to suit our needs (e.g. we will not be able to enhance the schema of an already existing LDAP Directory). In most of the cases our access will be read-only.\nSidenote: There is a difference between users, identities and accounts: A user may have multiple identities which he can authenticate with, e.g. his facebook, twitter, microsoft or google identity. Multiple identities can be linked to an account in ocis, allowing to fall back to another identity provider should one of them shut down. This also allows migrating from one identity provider to another.\nThere are different cases where oCIS requires access to users:\nWhile we settled on using OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the authentication protocol for oCIS, we need to build a user object during authentication with at least an account UUID (to identify the account) and the email or a name (for display purposes). When searching for share recipients we need to be able to query existing users in the external identity management system When listing files we need to be able to look up a users display properties (username, email, avatar\u0026hellip;) based on the account UUID oCIS internally relies on a stable and persistent identifier (e.g. a UUID) for accounts in order to implement permissions and sharing. Unfortunately, some deployments are unable to deliver this kind of stable identifier for users:\nIn OIDC itself the only stable identifier that is guaranteed to be provided by the IDP is combination of the sub and iss claims. IDPs can optionally return other claims, but we cannot rely on a specific claim being present. When no other services (LDAP, SCIM, \u0026hellip;) are available that could be used look up a user UUID Decision Drivers oCIS should be a single binary that can run out of the box without external dependencies like an LDAP server. Time: we want to build a release candidate asap. oCIS should be easy to integrate with standard external identity management systems Considered Options There are two case to consider:\nExternal identity management system provides an OIDC IdP and an interface to query users External identity management system provides just an OIDC IdP with no possibility to query users Decision Outcome It\u0026rsquo;s not really possible single out any of the options for this ADR. In the end we will likely need to support both scenarios.\nPositive Consequences: Very flexible integration with a wide range of external systems Negative consequences: configuration complexity, high support efforts Increasingly complex code in oCIS Pros and Cons of the Options External identity management system is read only and provides an interface to query users (e.g. Corporate Active Directory) IdP sends sub \u0026amp; iss and mail or username claims, Identity Management System provides APIs (e.g. LDAP, SCIM, REST \u0026hellip;) to lookup additional user information. All oCIS services use the CS3 API to look up the account for the given email or username, where CS3 then uses a backend that relies on the APIs provided by the IdM.\nGood, because we can rely on the external identity management Good, because ocis services only need to know about the CS3 user provider API, which acts as an abstraction layer for different identity management systems Good, because there is only a single source of truth (the external IdM) and we don\u0026rsquo;t need to implement a synchronization mechanism to maintain an internal user database (we will likely need some form of caching though, see below) Bad, because the identity management needs to provide a stable, persistent, non-reassignable user identifier for an account, e.g. owncloudUUID or ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid Bad, because we need to implement tools that can change the account id when it did change anyway Bad, because without caching we will hammer the identity management system with lookup requests External identity management system is read only and does NOT provide an API to query users Idp sends sub \u0026amp; iss and mail or username claims.

PR welcome.\nLogical concepts Resources A resource is the basic building block that oCIS manages. It can be of different types:\nan actual file a container, e.g. a folder or bucket a symlink, or a reference which can point to a resource in another storage provider References A reference identifies a resource. A CS3 reference can carry a path and a CS3 resource id. The references come in two flavors: absolute and combined. Absolute references have either the path or the resource id set:\nAn absolute path MUST start with a /. The resource id MUST be empty. An absolute resource id uniquely identifies a resource and is used as a stable identifier for sharing. The path MUST be empty. Combined references have both, path and resource id set: the resource id identifies the root resource the path is relative to that root. It MUST start with . References A reference is a logical concept that identifies a resource. A CS3 reference consists of either\na path based reference, used to identify a resource in the namespace of a storage provider. It must start with a /. a CS3 id based reference, uniquely identifying a resource in the namespace of a storage provider. It consists of a storage provider id and an opaque id. The storage provider id must NOT start with a /. The / is important because currently the static storage registry uses a map to look up which storage provider is responsible for the resource. Paths must be prefixed with / so there can be no collisions between paths and storage provider ids in the same map. Storage Drivers A storage driver implements access to a storage system:\nIt maps the path and id based CS3 references to an appropriate storage system specific reference, e.g.:\neos file ids posix inodes or paths deconstructed filesystem nodes Proposed Change iOS clients can only queue single requests to be executed in the background. The queue an upload and need to be able to identify the uploaded file after it has been uploaded to the server. The disconnected nature of the connection might cause workflows or manual user interaction with the file on the server to move the file to a different place or changing the content while the device is offline. However, on the device users might have marked the file as favorite or added it to other iOS specific collections. To be able to reliably identify the file the client can generate a uuid and attach it to the file metadata during the upload. While it is not necessary to look up files by this uuid having a second file id that serves exactly the same purpose as the file id is redundant.\nAnother aspect for the file id / uuid is that it must be a logical identifier that can be set, at least by internal systems. Without a writeable fileid we cannot restore backups or migrate storage spaces from one storage provider to another storage provider.\nTechnically, this means that every storage driver needs to have a map of a uuid to in internal resource identifier. This internal resource identifier can be\nan eos fileid, because eos can look up files by id an inode if the filesystem and the storage driver support looking up by inode a path if the storage driver has no way of looking up files by id. In this case other mechanisms like inotify, kernel audit or a fuse overlay might be used to keep the paths up to date. to prevent excessive writes when deep folders are renamed a reverse map might be used: it will map the uuid to \u0026lt;parentuuid\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;childname\u0026gt;, allowing to trade writes for reads Storage Providers Technical concepts Storage Systems A storage provider manages multiple storage spaces by accessing a storage system with a storage driver.\nStorage Space Registries A storage spaces registry manages the namespace for a user\nStorage Spaces A storage space is a logical concept: It is a tree of resourcesresources with a single owner (user or group), a quota and permissions, identified by a storage space id.\nExamples would be every user\u0026rsquo;s home storage space, project storage spaces or group storage spaces. While they all serve different purposes and may or may not have workflows like antivirus scanning enabled, we need a way to identify and manage these subtrees in a generic way. By creating a dedicated concept for them this becomes easier and literally makes the codebase cleaner. A storage space registry then allows listing the capabilities of storage spaces, e.g. free space, quota, owner, syncable, root etag, upload workflow steps, \u0026hellip;\nFinally, a logical storage space id is not tied to a specific storage provider. If the storage driver supports it, we can import existing files including their file id, which makes it possible to move storage spaces between storage providers to implement storage classes, e.g. with or without archival, workflows, on SSDs or HDDs.\nShares To be clarified: we are aware that storage spaces may be too \u0026lsquo;heavyweight\u0026rsquo; for ad hoc sharing with groups. That being said, there is no technical reason why group shares should not be treated like storage spaces that users can provision themselves. They would share the quota with the users home storage space and the share initiator would be the sole owner. Technically, the mechanism of treating a share like a new storage space would be the same. This obviously also extends to user shares and even file individual shares that would be wrapped in a virtual collection. It would also become possible to share collections of arbitrary files in a single storage space, e.g. the ten best pictures from a large album.\nStorage Systems Every storage system has different native capabilities like id and path based lookups, recursive change time propagation, permissions, trash, versions, archival and more. A storage provider makes the storage system available in the CS3 API by wrapping the capabilities as good as possible using a storage driver. There might be multiple storage drivers for a storage system, implementing different tradeoffs to match varying requirements.\nGateways A gateway acts as a facade to the storage related services. It authenticates and forwards API calls that are publicly accessible.\n","description":"Communication is hard. And clear communication is even harder.

Maybe an ADR is in order for all of the below.\nReva Gateway changes A dedicated shares storage provider Currently, when a user accepts a share, a cs3 reference is created in the users /home/shares folder. This reference represents the mount point of a share and can be renamed, similar to the share jail in ownCloud 10. This spreads the metadata of a share in two places:\nthe share is persisted in the share manager the mount point of a share is persisted in the home storage provider Furthermore, the gateway treats /home/shares different than any other path: it will stat all children and calculate an etag to allow clients to discover changes in accepted shares. This requires the storage provider to cooperate and provide this special /shares folder in the root of a users home when it is accessed as a home storage. That is the origin of the enable_home config flag that needs to be implemented for every storage driver.\nIn order to have a single source of truth we need to make the share manager aware of the mount point. We can then move all the logic that aggregates the etag in the share folder to a dedicated shares storage provider that is using the share manager for persistence. The shares storage provider would provide a /shares namespace outside of /home that lists all accepted shares for the current user. As a result the storage drivers no longer need to have a enable_home flag that jails users into their home. The /home/shares folder would move outside of the /home. In fact /home will no longer be needed, because the home folder concept can be implemented as a space: CreateHome would create a personal space on the.\nWork on this is done in https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/2023\nWhat about copy pasting links from the browser? Well this storage is only really needed to have a path to ocm shares that actually reside on other instances. In the UI the shares would be listed by querying a share manager. It returns ResourceIds, which can be stated to fetch a path that is then accessible in the CS3 global namespace. Two caveats:\nThis only works for resources that are actually hosted by the current instance. For those it would leak the parent path segments to a shared resource. For accepted OCM shares there must be a path in the CS3 global namespace that has to be the same for all users, otherwise they cannot copy and share those URLs. The gateway should be responsible for path transformations Currently, storage providers are aware af their mount point, coupling them tightly with the gateway.\nTracked in https://github.com/cs3org/reva/issues/578\nWork is done in https://github.com/cs3org/reva/pull/1866\nURL escaped string representation of a CS3 reference For the spaces concept we introduced the /dav/spaces/ endpoint. It encodes a cs3 reference in a URL compatible way.\nWe can separate the path using a /: /dav/spaces/\u0026lt;spaceid\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;path\u0026gt; The spaceid currently is a cs3 resourceid, consisting of \u0026lt;storageid\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;opaqueid\u0026gt;. Since the opaqueid might contain / e.g. for the local driver we have to urlencode the spaceid. To access resources by id we need to make the /dav/meta/\u0026lt;resourceid\u0026gt; able to list directories\u0026hellip; Otherwise id based navigation first has to look up the path. Or we use the libregraph api for id based navigation.\nA reference is a logical concept. It identifies a resource and consists of a \u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; and a \u0026lt;path\u0026gt;. A \u0026lt;resource_id\u0026gt; consists of a \u0026lt;storage_id\u0026gt; and a \u0026lt;node_id\u0026gt;.

But it can also be derived from a migration of an oc10 instance by concatenating an instance identifier and the numeric storage id from oc10, e.g. oc10-instance-a$1234.\nA reference will often start as an absolute/global path, e.g. !:/home/Projects/Foo. The gateway will look up the storage provider that is responsible for the path\nName Description Who resolves it? !:/home/Projects/Foo the absolute path a client like davfs will use. The gateway uses the storage registry to look up the responsible storage provider ee1687e5-ac7f-426d-a6c0-03fed91d5f62!:/Projects/Foo the storage_space is the same as the root, the path becomes relative to the root the storage provider can use this reference to identify this resource Now, the same file is accessed as a share\nName Description !:/users/Einstein/Projects/Foo Foo is the shared folder ee1687e5-ac7f-426d-a6c0-03fed91d5f62!56f7ceca-e7f8-4530-9a7a-fe4b7ec8089a: 56f7ceca-e7f8-4530-9a7a-fe4b7ec8089a is the id of Foo, the path is empty The :, ! and $ are chosen from the set of RFC3986 sub delimiters on purpose. They can be used in URLs without having to be encoded. In some cases, a delimiter can be left out if a component is not set:\nreference interpretation /absolute/path/to/file.ext absolute path, all delimiters omitted ee1687e5-ac7f-426d-a6c0-03fed91d5f62!path/to/file.ext relative path in the given storage space, root delimiter : omitted 56f7ceca-e7f8-4530-9a7a-fe4b7ec8089a:to/file.ext relative path in the given root node, storage space delimiter ! omitted ee1687e5-ac7f-426d-a6c0-03fed91d5f62!56f7ceca-e7f8-4530-9a7a-fe4b7ec8089a: node id in the given storage space, : must be present ee1687e5-ac7f-426d-a6c0-03fed91d5f62 root of the storage space, all delimiters omitted, can be distinguished by the / space providers When looking up an id based resource the reference must use a logical space id, not a CS3 resource id. Otherwise id based requests, which only have a resourceid consisting of a storage id and a node id cannot be routed to the correct storage provider if the storage has moved from one storage provider to another.\nif the registry routes based on the storageid AND the nodeid it has to keep a cache of all nodeids in order to route all requests for a storage space (which consists of storage it + nodeid) to the correct storage provider. the correct resourceid for a node in a storage space would be \u0026lt;storageid\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;rootnodeid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;nodeid\u0026gt;. The \u0026lt;storageid\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;rootnodeid\u0026gt; part allow the storage registry to route all id based requests to the correct storage provider. This becomes relevant when the storage space was moved from one storage provider to another. The storage space id remains the same, but the internal address and port change.\nTODO discuss to clarify further\nStorage drivers allow clients to send a uuid on upload iOS clients can only queue single requests to be executed in the background. They queue an upload and need to be able to identify the uploaded file after it has been uploaded to the server. The disconnected nature of the connection might cause workflows or manual user interaction with the file on the server to move the file to a different place or changing the content while the device is offline. However, on the device users might have marked the file as favorite or added it to other iOS specific collections. To be able to reliably identify the file the client can generate a uuid and attach it to the file metadata during the upload. While it is not necessary to look up files by this uuid having a second file id that serves exactly the same purpose as the file id is redundant.\nAnother aspect for the file id / uuid is that it must be a logical identifier that can be set, at least by internal systems. Without a writeable fileid we cannot restore backups or migrate storage spaces from one storage provider to another storage provider.\nTechnically, this means that every storage driver needs to have a map of a uuid to an internal resource identifier. This internal resource identifier can be\nan eos fileid, because eos can look up files by id an inode if the filesystem and the storage driver support looking up by inode a path if the storage driver has no way of looking up files by id. In this case other mechanisms like inotify, kernel audit or a fuse overlay might be used to keep the paths up to date. to prevent excessive writes when deep folders are renamed a reverse map might be used: it will map the uuid to \u0026lt;parentuuid\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;childname\u0026gt;, in order to trade writes for reads as a fallback a sync job can read the file id from the metadata of the resources and populate the uuid to internal id map. The TUS upload can take metadata, for PUT we might need a header.\nSpace id vs resource id vs storage id We have /dav/meta/\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; where the fileid is a string that was returned by a PROPFIND or by the /graph/v1.0/me/drives/ endpoint? That returns a space id and the root drive item which has an id\nDoes that id have a specific format? We currently concatenate as \u0026lt;storageid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;nodeid\u0026gt;.\nA request against /dav/meta/fileid will use the reva storage registry to look up a path.\nWhat if the storage space is moved to another storage provider. This happens during a migration:\nthe current oc10 fileids need to be prefixed with at least the numeric storage id to shard them. 123 becomes instanceprefix$345!123 if we use a custom prefix that identifies an instance (so we can merge multiple instances into one ocis instance) and append the numeric storageid 345. The pattern is \u0026lt;instanceprefix\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;numericstorageid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt;.\nEvery \u0026lt;instanceprefix\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;numericstorageid\u0026gt; identifies a space.\nthe owncloudsql driver can return these spaceids when listing spaces. Why does it not work if we just use the fileid of the root node in the db?\nSay we have a space with three resources: \u0026lt;instanceprefix\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;numericstorageid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; instanceprefix$345!1 instanceprefix$345!2 instanceprefix$345!3\nAll users have moved to ocis and the registry contains a regex to route all instanceprefix.* references to the storageprovider with the owncloudsql driver. It is up to the driver to locate the correct resource by using the filecache table. In this case the numeric storage id is unnecessary.\nNow we migrate the space 345 to another storage driver:\nthe storage registry contains a new entry for instanceprefix$345 to send all resource ids for that space to the new storage provider the new storage driver has to take into account the full storageid because the nodeid may only be unique per storage space. If we now have to fetch the path on the /dav/meta/ endpoint: /dav/meta/instanceprefix$345!1 /dav/meta/instanceprefix$345!2 /dav/meta/instanceprefix$345!3\nThis would work because the registry always sees instanceprefix$345 as the storageid.\nNow if we use the fileids directly and leave out the numeric storageid: \u0026lt;instanceprefix\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; instanceprefix!1 instanceprefix!2 instanceprefix!3\nThis is the current \u0026lt;storageid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;nodeid\u0026gt; format.\nThe reva storage registry contains a instanceid entry pointing to the storage provider with the owncloudsql driver.\nResources can be looked up because the oc_filecache has a unique fileid over all storages.\nNow we again migrate the space 345 to another storage driver:\nthe storage registry contains a new entry for instanceprefix!1 so the storage space root now points to the new storage provider The registry needs to be aware of node ids to route properly. This is a no-go. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep a cache of all nodeids in the registry. Only the root nodes of spaces. The new storage driver only has a nodeid which might collide with other nodeids from other storage spaces, e.g. when two instances are imported into one ocis instance. Although it would be possible to just set up two storage providers extra care would have to be taken to prevent nodeid collisions when importing a space. If we now have to fetch the path on the /dav/meta/ endpoint: /dav/meta/instanceprefix!1 would work because it is the root of a space /dav/meta/instanceprefix!2 would cause the gateway to poll all storage providers because the registry has no way to determine the responsible storage provider /dav/meta/instanceprefix!3 same\nThe problem is that without a part in the storageid that allows differentiating storage spaces we cannot route them individually.\nNow, we could use the nodeid of the root of a storage space as the spaceid \u0026hellip; if it is a uuid. If it is numeric it needs a prefix to distinguish it from other spaces. \u0026lt;space-root-uuid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; would be easy for the decomposedfs. eos might use numeric ids: \u0026lt;eosprefix\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;space-root-fileid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt;, but it needs a custom prefix to distinguish multiple eos instances.\nFurthermore, when migrating spaces between storage providers we want to stay collision free, which is why we should recommend uuids.\nAll this has implications for the decomposedfs, because it needs to split the nodes per space to prevent them from colliding.\n","description":"Some architectural changes still need to be clarified or changed.

The ANTIVIRUS_SCANNER_TYPE environment variable is used to select the scanner. The detailed configuration for each scanner heavily depends on the scanner type selected. See the environment variables for more details.\nFor icap, only scanners using the X-Infection-Found header are currently supported. For clamav only local sockets can currently be configured. Maximum Scan Size Several factors can make it necessary to limit the maximum filesize the antivirus service will use for scanning. Use the ANTIVIRUS_MAX_SCAN_SIZE environment variable to scan only a given amount of bytes. Obviously, it is recommended to scan the whole file, but several factors like scanner type and version, bandwidth, performance issues, etc. might make a limit necessary.\nInfected File Handling The antivirus service allows three different ways of handling infected files. Those can be set via the ANTIVIRUS_INFECTED_FILE_HANDLING environment variable:\ndelete: (default): Infected files will be deleted immediately, further postprocessing is cancelled. abort: (advanced option): Infected files will be kept, further postprocessing is cancelled. Files can be manually retrieved and inspected by an admin. To identify the file for further investigation, the antivirus service logs the abort/infected state including the file ID. The file is located in the storage/users/uploads folder of the ocis data directory and persists until it is manually deleted by the admin via the Manage Unfinished Uploads command. continue: (obviously not recommended): Infected files will be marked via metadata as infected but postprocessing continues normally. Note: Infected Files are moved to their final destination and therefore not prevented from download which includes the risk of spreading viruses. In all cases, a log entry is added declaring the infection and handling method and a notification via the userlog service sent.\nScanner Inaccessibility In case a scanner is not accessible by the antivirus service like a network outage, service outage or hardware outage, the antivirus service uses the abort case for further processing, independent of the actual setting made. In any case, an error is logged noting the inaccessibility of the scanner used.\nOperation Modes The antivirus service can scan files during postprocessing. on demand scanning is currently not available and might be added in a future release.\nPostprocessing The antivirus service will scan files during postprocessing. It listens for a postprocessing step called virusscan. This step can be added in the environment variable POSTPROCESSING_STEPS. Read the documentation of the postprocessing service for more details.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 # Autogenerated # Filename: antivirus-config-example.yaml file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9277 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; infected-file-handling: delete events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; scanner: type: clamav clamav: socket: /run/clamav/clamd.ctl icap: timeout: 0 scan_timeout: 5m0s url: icap://127.0.0.1:1344 service: avscan max-scan-size: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_LOG_LEVELANTIVIRUS_LOG_LEVEL string The log level.

As of now, these services exist:\nauth-basic handles basic authentication auth-bearer handles oidc authentication auth-machine handles interservice authentication when a user is impersonated auth-service handles interservice authentication when using service accounts Auth Managers Since the auth-basic service does not do any validation itself, it needs to be configured with an authentication manager. One can use the AUTH_BASIC_AUTH_MANAGER environment variable to configure this. Currently only one auth manager is supported: \u0026quot;ldap\u0026quot;\nLDAP Auth Manager Setting AUTH_BASIC_AUTH_MANAGER to \u0026quot;ldap\u0026quot; will configure the auth-basic service to use LDAP as auth manager. This is the recommended option for running in a production and testing environment. More details on how to configure LDAP with ocis can be found in the admin docs.\nOther Auth Managers oCIS currently supports no other auth manager\nScalability When using \u0026quot;ldap\u0026quot; as auth manager, there is no persistance as requests will just be forwarded to the LDAP server.

To use more than one auth provider per deployment you need to scale the gateway.\nThis will change when we use the service registry in more places and use micro clients to select an instance of a service.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 # Autogenerated # Filename: auth-bearer-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9149 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false grpc: addr: 127.0.0.1:9148 tls: null protocol: tcp token_manager: jwt_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva: address: com.owncloud.api.gateway tls: mode: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; cacert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; skip_user_groups_in_token: false oidc: issuer: https://localhost:9200 insecure: false id_claim: preferred_username uid_claim: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; gid_claim: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDAUTH_BEARER_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

The request must contain the event ID that should be retrieved.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 # Autogenerated # Filename: eventhistory-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9270 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false grpc: addr: 127.0.0.1:0 tls: null grpc_client_tls: null events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; store: store: memory nodes: [] database: eventhistory table: events ttl: 336h0m0s size: 0 username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDEVENTHISTORY_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

","description":"Abstract The eventhistory consumes all events from the configured event system like NATS, stores them and allows other services to retrieve them via an event ID.\nTable of Contents Prerequisites Consuming Storing Retrieving Example Yaml Config Prerequisites Running the eventhistory service without an event system like NATS is not possible.\nConsuming The eventhistory services consumes all events from the configured event system.\nStoring The eventhistory service stores each consumed event via the configured store in EVENTHISTORY_STORE."},{"id":63,"href":"/services/frontend/","title":"Frontend","parent":"Services","content":" Abstract The frontend service translates various owncloud related HTTP APIs to CS3 requests.\nTable of Contents Endpoints Overview appprovider archiver datagateway ocs Sharing Scalability Define Read-Only Attributes Caching Event Handler Auto-Accept Shares The password policy The password policy capability Example Yaml Config Endpoints Overview Currently, the frontend service handles requests for three functionalities, which are appprovider, archiver, datagateway and ocs.\nappprovider The appprovider endpoint, by default /app, forwards HTTP requests to the CS3 App Registry API\narchiver The archiver endpoint, by default /archiver, implements zip and tar download for collections of files. It will internally use the CS3 API to initiate downloads and then stream the individual files as part of a compressed file.\ndatagateway The datagateway endpoint, by default /data, forwards file up- and download requests to the correct CS3 data provider. OCIS starts a dataprovider as part of the storage-* services. The routing happens based on the JWT that was created by a storage provider in response to an InitiateFileDownload or InitiateFileUpload request.\nocs The ocs endpoint, by default /ocs, implements the ownCloud 10 Open Collaboration Services API by translating it into CS3 API requests. It can handle users, groups, capabilities and also implements the files sharing functionality on top of CS3. The /ocs/v[12].php/cloud/user/signing-key is currently handled by the dedicated ocs service.\nSharing Aggregating share information is one of the most time consuming operations in OCIS. The service fetches a list of either received or created shares and has to stat every resource individually. While stats are fast, the default behavior scales linearly with the number of shares.\nTo save network trips the sharing implementation can cache the stat requests with an in memory cache or in Redis. It will shorten the response time by the network round-trip overhead at the cost of the API only eventually being updated.\nSetting FRONTEND_OCS_RESOURCE_INFO_CACHE_TTL=60 would cache the stat info for 60 seconds. Increasing this value makes sense for large deployments with thousands of active users that keep the cache up to date. Low frequency usage scenarios should not expect a noticeable improvement.\nScalability While the frontend service does not persist any data, it does cache information about files and filesystem (Stat()) responses and user information. Therefore, multiple instances of this service can be spawned in a bigger deployment like when using container orchestration with Kubernetes, when configuring FRONTEND_OCS_RESOURCE_INFO_CACHE_STORE and the related config options.\nDefine Read-Only Attributes A lot of user management is made via the standardized libregraph API. Depending on how the system is configured, there might be some user attributes that an ocis instance admin can\u0026rsquo;t change because of properties coming from an external LDAP server, or similar. This can be the case when the ocis admin is not the LDAP admin. To ease life for admins, there are hints as capabilites telling the frontend which attributes are read-only to enable a different optical representation like being grayed out. To configure these hints, use the environment variable FRONTEND_READONLY_USER_ATTRIBUTES, which takes a comma separated list of attributes, see the envvar for supported values.\nYou can find more details regarding available attributes at the libre-graph-api openapi-spec and on owncloud.dev.\nCaching The frontend service can use a configured store via FRONTEND_OCS_STAT_CACHE_STORE. Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc. Event Handler The frontend service contains an eventhandler for handling ocs related events. As of now, it only listens to the ShareCreated event.\nAuto-Accept Shares When setting the FRONTEND_AUTO_ACCEPT_SHARES to true, all incoming shares will be accepted automatically. Users can overwrite this setting individually in their profile.\nThe password policy Note that the password policy currently impacts only public link password validation.\nIn Infinite Scale, the password policy is always enabled because the max-length restriction is always applying and should be taken into account by the clients.\nWith the password policy, mandatory criteria for the password can be defined via the environment variables listed below.\nGenerally, a password can contain any UTF-8 characters, however some characters are regarded as special since they are not used in ordinary texts. Which characters should be treated as special is defined by \u0026ldquo;The OWASP® Foundation\u0026rdquo; password-special-characters (between double quotes): \u0026quot; !\u0026quot;#$%\u0026amp;\u0026rsquo;()*+,-./:;\u0026lt;=\u0026gt;?@[]^_`{|}~\u0026quot;\nThe validation against the banned passwords list can be configured via a text file with words separated by new lines. If a user tries to set a password listed in the banned passwords list, the password can not be used (is invalid) even if the other mandatory criteria are passed. The admin can define the path of the banned passwords list file. If the file doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in a location, Infinite Scale tries to load a file from the OCIS_CONFIG_DIR/OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_BANNED_PASSWORDS_LIST. An option will be enabled when the file has been loaded successfully.\nFollowing environment variables can be set to define the password policy behaviour:\nOCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_DISABLED Disable the password policy OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_CHARACTERS Define the minimum password length. OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_LOWERCASE_CHARACTERS Define the minimum number of uppercase letters. OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_UPPERCASE_CHARACTERS Define the minimum number of lowercase letters. OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_DIGITS Define the minimum number of digits. OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_MIN_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS Define the minimum number of special characters. OCIS_PASSWORD_POLICY_BANNED_PASSWORDS_LIST Path to the \u0026lsquo;banned passwords list\u0026rsquo; file. These variables are global ocis variables because they are used not only in the frontend service, but also in the sharing service.\nNote that a password can have a maximum length of 72 bytes. Depending on the alphabet used, a character is encoded by 1 to 4 bytes, defining the maximum length of a password indirectly. While US-ASCII will only need one byte, Latin alphabets and also Greek or Cyrillic ones need two bytes. Three bytes are needed for characters in Chinese, Japanese and Korean etc.\nThe password policy capability The capabilities endpoint (e.g. https://ocis.test/ocs/v1.php/cloud/capabilities?format=json) gives you following capabilities which are relevant for the password policy:\n{ \u0026#34;ocs\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;capabilities\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;password_policy\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;min_characters\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;max_characters\u0026#34;: 72, \u0026#34;min_lowercase_characters\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;min_uppercase_characters\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;min_digits\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;min_special_characters\u0026#34;: 1 } } } } } Example Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 # Autogenerated # Filename: frontend-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9141 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false http: addr: 127.0.0.1:9140 protocol: tcp prefix: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; cors: allow_origins: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; allow_methods: - OPTIONS - HEAD - GET - PUT - POST - DELETE - MKCOL - PROPFIND - PROPPATCH - MOVE - COPY - REPORT - SEARCH allow_headers: - Origin - Accept - Content-Type - Depth - Authorization - Ocs-Apirequest - If-None-Match - If-Match - Destination - Overwrite - X-Request-Id - X-Requested-With - Tus-Resumable - Tus-Checksum-Algorithm - Upload-Concat - Upload-Length - Upload-Metadata - Upload-Defer-Length - Upload-Expires - Upload-Checksum - Upload-Offset - X-HTTP-Method-Override - Cache-Control allow_credentials: true transfer_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; token_manager: jwt_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva: address: com.owncloud.api.gateway tls: mode: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; cacert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; machine_auth_api_key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; skip_user_groups_in_token: false enable_favorites: false enable_project_spaces: true enable_share_jail: true max_quota: 0 upload_max_chunk_size: 10000000 upload_http_method_override: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; default_upload_protocol: tus enable_resharing: true enable_federated_sharing_incoming: false enable_federated_sharing_outgoing: false search_min_length: 3 edition: Community disable_sse: false default_link_permissions: 1 public_url: https://localhost:9200 app_handler: insecure: false archiver: max_num_files: 10000 max_size: 1073741824 insecure: false data_gateway: prefix: data ocs: prefix: ocs share_prefix: /Shares home_namespace: /users/{{.Id.OpaqueId}} additional_info_attribute: \u0026#39;{{.Mail}}\u0026#39; stat_cache_type: memory stat_cache_nodes: - 127.0.0.1:9233 stat_cache_database: cache-stat stat_cache_table: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; stat_cache_ttl: 5m0s stat_cache_size: 0 stat_cache_disable_persistence: false enable_denials: false list_ocm_shares: true public_sharing_share_must_have_password: true public_sharing_writeableshare_must_have_password: false include_ocm_sharees: false checksums: supported_types: - sha1 - md5 - adler32 preferred_upload_type: sha1 read_only_user_attributes: [] ldap_server_write_enabled: true full_text_search: false middleware: auth: credentials_by_user_agent: {} events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; grpc_client_tls: null auto_accept_shares: true service_account: service_account_id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; service_account_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password_policy: min_characters: 8 min_lowercase_characters: 1 min_uppercase_characters: 1 min_digits: 1 min_special_characters: 1 banned_passwords_list: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDFRONTEND_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

Other services never talk to the storage providers directly but will always send their requests via the gateway service.\nTable of Contents Caching Example Yaml Config Caching The gateway service is using caching as it is highly frequented with the same requests. As of now it uses two different caches:\nthe provider cache is caching requests to list or get storage providers. the create home cache is caching requests to create personal spaces (as they only need to be executed once). Both caches can be configured via the OCIS_CACHE_* envvars (or GATEWAY_PROVIDER_CACHE_* and GATEWAY_CREATE_HOME_CACHE_* respectively). See the envvar section for details.\nUse OCIS_CACHE_STORE (GATEWAY_PROVIDER_CACHE_STORE, GATEWAY_CREATE_HOME_CACHE_STORE) to define the type of cache to use:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc.

It is started as part of the default configuration and serves as a central place for storing user and group information.\nIt is mainly targeted at small oCIS installations. For larger setups it is recommended to replace IDM with a “real” LDAP server or to switch to an external identity management solution.\nIDM listens on port 9235 by default. In the default configuration it only accepts TLS-protected connections (LDAPS). The BaseDN of the LDAP tree is o=libregraph-idm. IDM gives LDAP write permissions to a single user (DN: uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm). Any other authenticated user has read-only access. IDM stores its data in a boltdb file idm/ocis.boltdb inside the oCIS base data directory.\nNote: IDM is limited in its functionality. It only supports a subset of the LDAP operations (namely BIND, SEARCH, ADD, MODIFY, DELETE). Also, IDM currently does not do any schema verification (like. structural vs. auxiliary object classes, require and option attributes, syntax checks, …). Therefore it is not meant as a general purpose LDAP server.\nTable of Contents Example Yaml Config Example Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 # Autogenerated # Filename: idm-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9239 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false idm: ldaps_addr: 127.0.0.1:9235 cert: /var/lib/ocis/idm/ldap.crt key: /var/lib/ocis/idm/ldap.key database: /var/lib/ocis/idm/ocis.boltdb create_demo_users: false service_user_passwords: admin_password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; idm_password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva_password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; idp_password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; admin_user_id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDIDM_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

For larger deployments, the Keycloak admin API can be used to provision users. In a future step, the endpoint, credentials and body might be made configurable using templates.\nKeycloak The default and currently only available backend used to handle invitations is Keycloak. Keycloak is an open source identity and access management (IAM) system which is also integrated by other Infinite Scale services as an authentication and authorization backend.\nKeycloak Realm Configuration See the example configuration json file of a Keycloak realm the backend will work with. This file includes the invitations client, which is relevant for this service.\nTo use the example json, set the INVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID setting to invitations, though any other client ID can be configured.\nImporting this example into Keycloak will give you a realm that federates with an LDAP server, has the right clients configured and all mappers correctly set. Be sure to set all the credentials after the import, as they will be disabled.\nThe most relevant bits are the mappers for the OWNCLOUD_ID and OWNCLOUD_USER_TYPE user properties.\nBackend Configuration After Keycloak has been configured, the invitation service needs to be configured with the following environment variables:\nINVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_BASE_PATH: The URL to access Keycloak. INVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID: The client ID of the client to use. In the above example, invitations is used. INVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET: The client secret used to authenticate. This can be found in the Keycloak UI. INVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_REALM: The realm where the client was added. In the example above, ocis is used. INVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_USER_REALM: The realm where to add the users. In the example above, ocis is used. INVITATIONS_KEYCLOAK_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY: If set to true, the verification of the Keycloak HTTPS certificate is skipped. This is not recommended in production environments. Bridging Provisioning Delay Consider that when a guest account has to be provisioned in an external user management, there might be a delay between creating the user and the user being available in the local Infinite Scale system.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 # Autogenerated # Filename: invitations-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:0 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false http: addr: 127.0.0.1:0 root: /graph/v1.0 cors: allow_origins: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; allow_methods: [] allow_headers: [] allow_credentials: false tls: enabled: false cert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; keycloak: base_path: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; client_id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; client_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; client_realm: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; user_realm: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; insecure_skip_verify: false token_manager: jwt_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDINVITATIONS_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

Email templates can use the placeholders {{ .Greeting }}, {{ .MessageBody }} and {{ .CallToAction }} which are replaced with translations when sent, see the Translations section for more details. Depending on the email purpose, placeholders will contain different strings. An individual translatable string is available for each purpose, finally resolved by the placeholder. Though the email subject is also part of translations, it has no placeholder as it is a mandatory email component. The embedded templates are available for all deployment scenarios.\ntemplate placeholders translated strings \u0026lt;-- source strings \u0026lt;-- purpose final output In addition, the notifications service supports custom templates. Custom email templates take precedence over the embedded ones. If a custom email template exists, the embedded templates are not used. To configure custom email templates, the NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH environment variable needs to point to a base folder that will contain the email templates and follow the templates subfolder hierarchy.This path must be available from all instances of the notifications service, a shared storage is recommended.\n{NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH}/templates/text/email.text.tmpl {NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH}/templates/html/email.html.tmpl {NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH}/templates/html/img/ The source templates provided by ocis you can derive from are located in the following base folder https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/tree/master/services/notifications/pkg/email/templates with subfolders templates/text and templates/html.\ntext/email.text.tmpl html/email.html.tmpl Templates subfolder hierarchy templates │ └───html │ │ email.html.tmpl │ │ │ └───img │ │ logo-mail.gif │ └───text │ email.text.tmpl Custom email templates referenced via NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_PATH must also be located in subfolder templates/text and templates/html and must have the same names as the embedded templates. It is important that the names of these files and folders match the embedded ones. The templates/html subfolder contains a default HTML template provided by ocis. When using a custom HTML template, hosted images can either be linked with standard HTML code like \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud/core/master/core/img/logo-mail.gif\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;logo-mail\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; or embedded as a CID source \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;cid:logo-mail.gif\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;logo-mail\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;. In the latter case, image files must be located in the templates/html/img subfolder. Supported embedded image types are png, jpeg, and gif. Consider that embedding images via a CID resource may not be fully supported in all email web clients.\nTranslations The notifications service has embedded translations sourced via transifex to provide a basic set of translated languages. These embedded translations are available for all deployment scenarios.\nIn addition, the service supports custom translations, though it is currently not possible to just add custom translations to embedded ones. If custom translations are configured, the embedded ones are not used. To configure custom translations, the NOTIFICATIONS_TRANSLATION_PATH environment variable needs to point to a base folder that will contain the translation files. This path must be available from all instances of the notifications service, a shared storage is recommended. Translation files must be of type .po or .mo. For each language, the filename needs to be translations.po (or translations.mo) and stored in a folder structure defining the language code. In general the path/name pattern for a translation file needs to be:\n{NOTIFICATIONS_TRANSLATION_PATH}/{language-code}/LC_MESSAGES/translations.po The language code pattern is composed of language[_territory] where language is the base language and _territory is optional and defines a country.\nFor example, for the language de, one needs to place the corresponding translation files to {NOTIFICATIONS_TRANSLATION_PATH}/de/LC_MESSAGES/translations.po.\nImportant: For the time being, the embedded ownCloud Web frontend only supports the main language code but does not handle any territory. When strings are available in the language code language_territory, the web frontend does not see it as it only requests language. In consequence, any translations made must exist in the requested language to avoid a fallback to the default.\nTranslation Rules If a requested language code is not available, the service tries to fall back to the base language if available. For example, if the requested language-code de_DE is not available, the service tries to fall back to translations in the de folder. If the base language de is also not available, the service falls back to the system\u0026rsquo;s default English (en), which is the source of the texts provided by the code. Default Language The default language can be defined via the OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE environment variable. See the settings service for a detailed description.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 # Autogenerated # Filename: notifications-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9174 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false ocis_url: https://localhost:9200 notifications: SMTP: smtp_host: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; smtp_port: 0 smtp_sender: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; smtp_username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; smtp_password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; insecure: false smtp_authentication: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; smtp_encryption: none events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; email_template_path: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; translation_path: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; default_language: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva_gateway: com.owncloud.api.gateway grpc_client_tls: null grpc_client_tls: mode: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; cacert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; service_account: service_account_id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; service_account_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDNOTIFICATIONS_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

Invitations are limited to trusted instances, however.\nThe list of trusted instances is managed by the ocmproviderauthorizer service. The only supported backend currently is json which stores the list in a json file on disk.\nExample providers.json file:\n[ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Example\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;full_name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Example provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organization\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Owncloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;domain\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;homepage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;services\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;endpoint\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OCM\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example.com Open Cloud Mesh API\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example.com - OCM API\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://example.com/ocm/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;is_monitored\u0026#34;: true }, \u0026#34;api_version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;example.com\u0026#34; } ] }, ] Invitation Workflow Before sharing a resource with a remote user this user has to be invited by the sharer.\nIn order to do so a POST request is sent to the generate-invite endpoint of the sciencemesh API. The generated token is passed on to the receiver, who will then use the accept-invite endpoint to accept the invitation. As a result remote users will be added to the ocminvitemanager on both sides. See invitation flow for the according sequence diagram.\nThe data backend of the ocminvitemanager is configurable. The only supported backend currently is json which stores the data in a json file on disk.\nCreating Shares OCM Shares are currently created using the ocs API, just like regular shares. The difference is the share type, which is 6 (ShareTypeFederatedCloudShare) in this case, and a few additional parameters required for identifying the remote user.\nSee Create share flow for the according sequence diagram.\nThe data backends of the ocmshareprovider and ocmcore services are configurable.

If the variable is mistyped or not found, the evaluation defaults to deny. Individual query definitions can be defined for each module.\nTo activate the policies service for a module, it must be started with a yaml configuration that points to at least one Rego file that contains the complete rule variable to be queried. Note that if the service is scaled horizontally, each instance should have access to the same Rego files to avoid unpredictable results. If a file path has been configured but the file it is not present or accessible, the evaluation defaults to deny.\nWhen using async post-processing via the postprocessing service, the value policies must be added to the POSTPROCESSING_STEPS configuration in the order in which the evaluation should take place. Example: First check if a file contains questionable content via policies. If it looks okay, continue to check for viruses.\nFor configuration examples, the Example Policies from below are used.\nModules gRPC API The gRPC API can be used by any other internal service. It can also be used for example by third parties to find out if an action is allowed or not. This layer is already used by the proxy middleware. There is no configuration necessary, because the query setting (complete rule variable) must be part of the request.\nProxy Middleware The proxy service already includes a middleware which uses the internal gRPC API to evaluate the policies. Since the proxy is in heavy use and every HTTP request is processed here, only simple and quick decisions should be evaluated. More complex queries such as file content evaluation are strongly discouraged.\nIf the evaluation in the proxy results in a \u0026ldquo;denied\u0026rdquo; outcome, the response will return a 403 Permission Denied with the following response body\n{ \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;deniedByPolicy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Operation denied due to security policies\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;innererror\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-09-19T13:22:20Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filename\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;File\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;method\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/dav/spaces/some-space-id/Folder/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;request-id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;9CFCE925-F9D9-4F26-AB3B-2C1C40A9CD0C\u0026#34; } } } Event Service (Postprocessing) This layer is event-based and part of the postprocessing service. Since processing at this point is asynchronous, the operations can also take longer and be more expensive, like evaluating the contents of a file.\nDefining Policies to Evaluate Each module can have as many policy files as needed for evaluation. Files can also include other files if necessary. To use policies, they have to be saved to a location that is accessible to the policies service. As a good starting point, take the config directory and use a subdirectory collecting all the .rego files, though any other directory can be defined. The config directory is already accessible by all services and usually is included in a xref:maintenance/b-r/backup.adoc[backup] plan.\nIf this is done, it\u0026rsquo;s required to configure the policies service to use these files:\nNOTE: It is important that all necessary files are added to the list of files the policies service uses.\npolicies: engine: policies: - your_path_to_policies/proxy.rego - your_path_to_policies/postprocessing.rego - your_path_to_policies/util.rego Once the references to policy files are configured correctly, the _QUERY configuration needs to be defined for the proxy middleware and for the events service.\nSetting the Query Configuration To define a value for the query evaluation, the following scheme is necessary:\ndata.\u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;complete-rule-variable-name\u0026gt;\nThe keyword data is mandatory and must be present. The package-name is defined in one .rego file like package postprocessing. It is not related to the filename. For more details, see the packages documentation. The complete-rule-variable-name is the variable providing the result of the evaluation. Exact one of the defined files, which is responsible for returning the evaluation result, must contain the combination of \u0026lt;package-name\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;complete-rule-variable-name\u0026gt;. Proxy Note that this setting has to be part of the proxy configuration.\nproxy: policies_middleware: query: data.proxy.granted The same can be achieved by setting the following environment variable:\nexport PROXY_POLICIES_QUERY=data.proxy.granted Postprocessing policies: postprocessing: query: data.postprocessing.granted The same can be achieved by setting the following environment variable:\nexport POLICIES_POSTPROCESSING_QUERY=data.postprocessing.granted As soon as that query is configured, the postprocessing service must be informed to use the policies step by setting the environment variable:\nexport POSTPROCESSING_STEPS=policies Note that additional steps can be configured and their position in the list defines the order of processing. For details see the postprocessing service documentation.\nRego Key Match To identify available keys for OPA, you need to look at engine.go and the policies.swagger.json file. Note that which keys are available depends on from which module it is used.\nExtend Mimetype File Extension Mapping In the extended set of the rego query language, it is possible to get a list of associated file extensions based on a mimetype, for example ocis.mimetype.extensions(\u0026quot;application/pdf\u0026quot;).\nThe list of mappings is restricted by default and is provided by the host system ocis is installed on.\nIn order to extend this list, ocis must be provided with the path to a custom mime.types file that maps mimetypes to extensions. The location for the file must be accessible by all instances of the policy service. As a rule of thumb, use the directory where the ocis configuration files are stored. Note that existing mappings from the host are extended by the definitions from the mime types file, but not replaced.\nThe path to that file can be provided via a yaml configuration or an environment variable. Note to replace the OCIS_CONFIG_DIR string by an existing path.\nexport POLICIES_ENGINE_MIMES=OCIS_CONFIG_DIR/mime.types policies: engine: mimes: OCIS_CONFIG_DIR/mime.types A good example of how such a file should be formatted can be found in the Apache svn repository.\nExample Policies The policies service contains a set of preconfigured example policies. See the deployment examples directory for details. The contained policies disallow Infinite Scale to create certain file types, both via the proxy middleware and the events service via postprocessing.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 # Autogenerated # Filename: policies-config-example.yaml grpc: addr: 127.0.0.1:9125 tls: null debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9129 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; grpc_client_tls: null log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; engine: timeout: 10s policies: [] mimes: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; postprocessing: query: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description POLICIES_GRPC_ADDR string 127.0.0.1:9125 The bind address of the GRPC service.

By default, ocis ships with a preconfigured nats service.\nPostprocessing Functionality The storageprovider service (storage-users) can be configured to initiate asynchronous postprocessing by setting the OCIS_ASYNC_UPLOADS environment variable to true. If this is the case, postprocessing will get initiated after uploading a file and all bytes have been received.\nThe postprocessing service will then coordinate configured postprocessing steps like scanning the file for viruses. During postprocessing, the file will be in a processing state where only a limited set of actions are available. Note that this processing state excludes file accessibility by users.\nWhen all postprocessing steps have completed successfully, the file will be made accessible for users.\nStoring Postprocessing Data The postprocessing service needs to store some metadata about uploads to be able to orchestrate post-processing. When running in single binary mode, the default in-memory implementation will be just fine. In distributed deployments it is recommended to use a persistent store, see below for more details.\nThe postprocessing service stores its metadata via the configured store in POSTPROCESSING_STORE. Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc. Additional Prerequisites for the Postprocessing Service When postprocessing has been enabled, configuring any postprocessing step will require the requested services to be enabled and pre-configured. For example, to use the virusscan step, one needs to have an enabled and configured antivirus service.\nPostprocessing Steps The postporcessing service is individually configurable. This is achieved by allowing a list of postprocessing steps that are processed in order of their appearance in the POSTPROCESSING_STEPS envvar. This envvar expects a comma separated list of steps that will be executed. Currently known steps to the system are virusscan and delay. Custom steps can be added but need an existing target for processing.\nVirus Scanning To enable virus scanning as a postprocessing step after uploading a file, the environment variable POSTPROCESSING_STEPS needs to contain the word virusscan at one location in the list of steps. As a result, each uploaded file gets virus scanned as part of the postprocessing steps. Note that the antivirus service is required to be enabled and configured for this to work.\nDelay Though this is for development purposes only and NOT RECOMMENDED on production systems, setting the environment variable POSTPROCESSING_DELAY to a duration not equal to zero will add a delay step with the configured amount of time. ocis will continue postprocessing the file after the configured delay. Use the environment variable POSTPROCESSING_STEPS and the keyword delay if you have multiple postprocessing steps and want to define their order. If POSTPROCESSING_DELAY is set but the keyword delay is not contained in POSTPROCESSING_STEPS, it will be processed as last postprocessing step without being listed there. In this case, a log entry will be written on service startup to notify the admin about that situation. That log entry can be avoided by adding the keyword delay to POSTPROCESSING_STEPS.\nCustom Postprocessing Steps By using the envvar POSTPROCESSING_STEPS, custom postprocessing steps can be added. Any word can be used as step name but be careful not to conflict with exising keywords like virusscan and delay. In addition, if a keyword is misspelled or the corresponding service does either not exist or does not follow the necessary event communication, the postprocessing service will wait forever getting the required response to proceed and does not continue any other processing.\nPrerequisites For using custom postprocessing steps you need a custom service listening to the configured event system (see General Prerequisites)\nWorkflow When defining a custom postprocessing step (eg. \u0026quot;customstep\u0026quot;), the postprocessing service will eventually send an event during postprocessing. The event will be of type StartPostprocessingStep with its field StepToStart set to \u0026quot;customstep\u0026quot;. When the service defined as custom step receives this event, it can safely execute its actions. The postprocessing service will wait until it has finished its work. The event contains further information (filename, executing user, size, \u0026hellip;) and also requires tokens and URLs to download the file in case byte inspection is necessary.\nOnce the service defined as custom step has finished its work, it should send an event of type PostprocessingFinished via the configured events system back to the postprocessing service. This event needs to contain a FinishedStep field set to \u0026quot;customstep\u0026quot;. It also must contain the outcome of the step, which can be one of the following:\ndelete: Abort postprocessing, delete the file. abort: Abort postprocessing, keep the file. retry: There was a problem that was most likely temporary and may be solved by trying again after some backoff duration. Retry runs automatically and is defined by the backoff behavior as described below. continue: Continue postprocessing, this is the success case. The backoff behavior as mentioned in the retry outcome can be configured using the POSTPROCESSING_RETRY_BACKOFF_DURATION and POSTPROCESSING_MAX_RETRIES environment variables. The backoff duration is calculated using the following formula after each failure: backoff_duration = POSTPROCESSING_RETRY_BACKOFF_DURATION * 2^(number of failures - 1). This means that the time between the next round grows exponentially limited by the number of retries. Steps that still don\u0026rsquo;t succeed after the maximum number of retries will be automatically moved to the abort state.\nSee the cs3 org for up-to-date information of reserved step names and event definitions.\nCLI Commands Resume Postprocessing If postprocessing fails in one step due to an unforseen error, current uploads will not be retried automatically. A system admin can instead run a CLI command to retry the failed upload which is a two step process:\nFirst find the upload ID of the failed upload. ocis storage-users uploads list Then use the restart command to resume postprocessing of the ID selected. ocis postprocessing restart -u \u0026lt;uploadID\u0026gt; Example Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 # Autogenerated # Filename: postprocessing-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9255 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false store: store: memory nodes: [] database: postprocessing table: postprocessing ttl: 0s size: 0 username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; postprocessing: events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; steps: [] delayprocessing: 0s retry_backoff_duration: 5s max_retries: 14 Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDPOSTPROCESSING_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

Every HTTP request goes through this service. Authentication, logging and other preprocessing of requests also happens here. Mechanisms like request rate limiting or intrusion prevention are not included in the proxy service and must be setup in front like with an external reverse proxy.\nThe proxy service is the only service communicating to the outside and needs therefore usual protections against DDOS, Slow Loris or other attack vectors. All other services are not exposed to the outside, but also need protective measures when it comes to distributed setups like when using container orchestration over various physical servers.\nTable of Contents Authentication Configuring Routes Automatic Quota Assignments Automatic Role Assignments Recommendations for Production Deployments Caching Special Settings Metrics 1) Single Process Mode-single-process-mode) 2) Standalone Mode-standalone-mode) Available Metrics Prometheus Configuration Example Yaml Config Authentication The following request authentication schemes are implemented:\nBasic Auth (Only use in development, never in production setups!) OpenID Connect Signed URL Public Share Token Configuring Routes The proxy handles routing to all endpoints that ocis offers. The currently availabe default routes can be found in the code. Changing or adding routes can be necessary when writing own ocis extensions.\nDue to the complexity when defining routes, these can only be defined in the yaml file but not via environment variables.\nFor overwriting default routes, use the following yaml example:\npolicies: - name: ocis routes: - endpoint: / service: com.owncloud.web.web - endpoint: /dav/ service: com.owncloud.web.ocdav For adding additional routes to the default routes use:\nadditional_policies: - name: ocis routes: - endpoint: /custom/endpoint service: com.owncloud.custom.custom A route has the following configurable parameters:\nendpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # the url that should be routed service: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # the service the url should be routed to unprotected: false # with false (default), calling the endpoint requires authorization. # with true, anyone can call the endpoint without authorisation. Automatic Quota Assignments It is possible to automatically assign a specific quota to new users depending on their role. To do this, you need to configure a mapping between roles defined by their ID and the quota in bytes. The assignment can only be done via a yaml configuration and not via environment variables. See the following proxy.yaml config snippet for a configuration example.\nrole_quotas: \u0026lt;role ID1\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;quota1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;role ID2\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;quota2\u0026gt; Automatic Role Assignments When users login, they do automatically get a role assigned. The automatic role assignment can be configured in different ways. The PROXY_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_DRIVER environment variable (or the driver setting in the role_assignment section of the configuration file select which mechanism to use for the automatic role assignment.\nWhen set to default, all users which do not have a role assigned at the time for the first login will get the role \u0026lsquo;user\u0026rsquo; assigned. (This is also the default behavior if PROXY_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_DRIVER is unset.\nWhen PROXY_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_DRIVER is set to oidc the role assignment for a user will happen based on the values of an OpenID Connect Claim of that user. The name of the OpenID Connect Claim to be used for the role assignment can be configured via the PROXY_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_OIDC_CLAIM environment variable. It is also possible to define a mapping of claim values to role names defined in ownCloud Infinite Scale via a yaml configuration. See the following proxy.yaml snippet for an example.\nrole_assignment: driver: oidc oidc_role_mapper: role_claim: ocisRoles role_mapping: - role_name: admin claim_value: myAdminRole - role_name: spaceadmin claim_value: mySpaceAdminRole - role_name: user claim_value: myUserRole - role_name: guest claim_value: myGuestRole This would assign the role admin to users with the value myAdminRole in the claim ocisRoles. The role user to users with the values myUserRole in the claims ocisRoles and so on.\nClaim values that are not mapped to a specific ownCloud Infinite Scale role will be ignored.\nNote: An ownCloud Infinite Scale user can only have a single role assigned. If the configured role_mapping and a user\u0026rsquo;s claim values result in multiple possible roles for a user, the order in which the role mappings are defined in the configuration is important. The first role in the role_mappings where the claim_value matches a value from the user\u0026rsquo;s roles claim will be assigned to the user. So if e.g. a user\u0026rsquo;s ocisRoles claim has the values myUserRole and mySpaceAdminRole that user will get the ocis role spaceadmin assigned (because spaceadmin appears before user in the above sample configuration).\nIf a user\u0026rsquo;s claim values don\u0026rsquo;t match any of the configured role mappings an error will be logged and the user will not be able to login.\nThe default role_claim (or PROXY_ROLE_ASSIGNMENT_OIDC_CLAIM) is roles. The default role_mapping is:\n- role_name: admin claim_value: ocisAdmin - role_name: spaceadmin claim_value: ocisSpaceAdmin - role_name: user claim_value: ocisUser - role_name: guest claim_value: ocisGuest Recommendations for Production Deployments In a production deployment, you want to have basic authentication (PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH) disabled which is the default state. You also want to setup a firewall to only allow requests to the proxy service or the reverse proxy if you have one. Requests to the other services should be blocked by the firewall.\nCaching The proxy service can use a configured store via PROXY_OIDC_USERINFO_CACHE_STORE. Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc. Special Settings When using the ocis IDP service instead of an external IDP:\nUse the environment variable OCIS_URL to define how ocis can be accessed, mandatory use https as protocol for the URL. If no reverse proxy is set up, the PROXY_TLS environment variable must be set to true because the embedded libreConnect shipped with the IDP service has a hard check if the connection is on TLS and uses the HTTPS protocol. If this mismatches, an error will be logged and no connection from the client can be established. PROXY_TLS can be set to false if a reverse proxy is used and the https connection is terminated at the reverse proxy. When setting to false, the communication between the reverse proxy and ocis is not secured. If set to true, you must provide certificates. Metrics The proxy service in ocis has the ability to expose metrics in the prometheus format. The metrics are exposed on the /metrics endpoint. There are two ways to run the ocis proxy service which has an impact on the number of metrics exposed.\n1) Single Process Mode In the single process mode, all ocis services are running inside a single process. This is the default mode when using the ocis server command to start the services. In this mode, the proxy service exposes metrics about the proxy service itself and about the ocis services it is proxying. This is due to the nature of the prometheus registry which is a singleton. The metrics exposed by the proxy service itself are prefixed with ocis_proxy_ and the metrics exposed by other ocis services are prefixed with ocis_\u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt;_.\n2) Standalone Mode In this mode, the proxy service only exposes its own metrics. The metrics of the other ocis services are exposed on their own metrics endpoints.\nAvailable Metrics The following metrics are exposed by the proxy service:\nMetric Name Description Labels ocis_proxy_requests_total Counter metric which reports the total number of HTTP requests. method: HTTP method of the request ocis_proxy_errors_total Counter metric which reports the total number of HTTP requests which have failed. That counts all response codes \u0026gt;= 500 method: HTTP method of the request ocis_proxy_duration_seconds Histogram of the time (in seconds) each request took. A histogram metric uses buckets to count the number of events that fall into each bucket. method: HTTP method of the request ocis_proxy_build_info{version} A metric with a constant 1 value labeled by version, exposing the version of the ocis proxy service. version: Build version of the proxy Prometheus Configuration The following is an example prometheus configuration for the single process mode. It assumes that the proxy debug address is configured to bind on all interfaces PROXY_DEBUG_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9205 and that the proxy is available via the ocis service name (typically in docker-compose). The prometheus service detects the /metrics endpoint automatically and scrapes it every 15 seconds.\nglobal: scrape_interval: 15s scrape_configs: - job_name: ocis_proxy static_configs: - targets: [\u0026#34;ocis:9205\u0026#34;] Example Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 # Autogenerated # Filename: proxy-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;

The following clarifies the extraction terms metadata and content:\nMetadata: all data that describes the file like Name, Size, MimeType, Tags and Mtime. Content: all data that relates to content of the file like words, geo data, exif data etc. Table of Contents General Considerations Search engines Query language Extraction Engines Content Extraction Basic Extractor Tika Extractor Search Functionality Indexing Search State Changes which Trigger Indexing Resource Trashed Resource Deleted Resource Restored Resource Moved Folder Created File Created File Version Restored Resource Tag Added Resource Tag Removed File Uploaded - Synchronous File Uploaded - Asynchronous Manually Trigger Re-Indexing a Space Notes Example Yaml Config General Considerations To use the search service, an event system needs to be configured for all services like NATS, which is shipped and preconfigured. The search service consumes events and does not block other tasks. When looking for content extraction, Apache Tika - a content analysis toolkit can be used but needs to be installed separately. Extractions are stored as index via the search service. Consider that indexing requires adequate storage capacity - and the space requirement will grow. To avoid filling up the filesystem with the index and rendering Infinite Scale unusable, the index should reside on its own filesystem.\nYou can change the path to where search maintains its data in case the filesystem gets close to full and you need to relocate the data. Stop the service, move the data, reconfigure the path in the environment variable and restart the service.\nWhen using content extraction, more resources and time are needed, because the content of the file needs to be analyzed. This is especially true for big and multiple concurrent files.\nThe search service runs out of the box with the shipped default basic configuration. No further configuration is needed, except when using content extraction.\nNote that as of now, the search service can not be scaled. Consider using a dedicated hardware for this service in case more resources are needed.\nSearch engines By default, the search service is shipped with bleve as its primary search engine. The available engines can be extended by implementing the Engine interface and making that engine available.\nQuery language By default, KQL is used as query language, for an overview of how the syntax works, please read the microsoft documentation.\nNot all parts are supported, the following list gives an overview of parts that are not implemented yet:\nSynonym operators Inclusion and exclusion operators Dynamic ranking operator ONEAR operator NEAR operator Date intervals In the following ADR you can read why we chose KQL.\nExtraction Engines The search service provides the following extraction engines and their results are used as index for searching:\nThe embedded basic configuration provides metadata extraction which is always on. The tika configuration, which additionally provides content extraction, if installed and configured. Content Extraction The search service is able to manage and retrieve many types of information. For this purpose the following content extractors are included:\nBasic Extractor This extractor is the most simple one and just uses the resource information provided by Infinite Scale. It does not do any further analysis. The following fields are included in the index: Name, Size, MimeType, Tags, Mtime.\nTika Extractor This extractor is more advanced compared to the Basic extractor. The main difference is that this extractor is able to search file contents. However, Apache Tika is required for this task. Read the Getting Started with Apache Tika guide on how to install and run Tika or use a ready to run Tika container. See the Tika container usage document for a quickstart. Note that at the time of writing, containers are only available for the amd64 platform.\nAs soon as Tika is installed and accessible, the search service must be configured for the use with Tika. The following settings must be set:\nSEARCH_EXTRACTOR_TYPE=tika SEARCH_EXTRACTOR_TIKA_TIKA_URL=http://YOUR-TIKA.URL When the search service can reach Tika, it begins to read out the content on demand. Note that files must be downloaded during the process, which can lead to delays with larger documents.\nContent extraction and handling the extracted content can be very resource intensive. Content extraction is therefore limited to files with a certain file size. The default limit is 20MB and can be configured using the SEARCH_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_SIZE_LIMIT variable.\nWhen extracting content, you can specify whether stop words like I, you, the are ignored or not. Noramlly, these stop words are removed automatically. To keep them, the environment variable SEARCH_EXTRACTOR_TIKA_CLEAN_STOP_WORDS must be set to false.\nWhen using the Tika container and docker-compose, consider the following:\nSee the ocis_wopi example. Containers for the linked service are reachable at a hostname identical to the alias or the service name if no alias was specified. If using the tika extractor, make sure to also set FRONTEND_FULL_TEXT_SEARCH_ENABLED in the frontend service to true. This will tell the webclient that full-text search has been enabled.\nSearch Functionality The search service consists of two main parts which are file indexing and file search.\nIndexing Every time a resource changes its state, a corresponding event is triggered. Based on the event, the search service processes the file and adds the result to its index. There are a few more steps between accepting the file and updating the index.\nSearch A query via the search service will return results based on the index created.\nState Changes which Trigger Indexing The following state changes in the life cycle of a file can trigger the creation of an index or an update:\nResource Trashed The service checks its index to see if the file has been processed. If an index entry exists, the index will be marked as deleted. In consequence, the file won\u0026rsquo;t appear in search requests anymore. The index entry stays intact and could be restored via Resource Restored.\nResource Deleted The service checks its index to see if the file has been processed. If an index entry exists, the index will be finally deleted. In consequence, the file won\u0026rsquo;t appear in search requests anymore.\nResource Restored This step is the counterpart of Resource Trashed. When a file is deleted, is isn\u0026rsquo;t removed from the index, instead the service just marks it as deleted. This mark is removed when the file has been restored, and it shows up in search results again.\nResource Moved This comes into play whenever a file or folder is renamed or moved. The search index then updates the resource location path or starts indexing if no index has been created so far for all items affected. See Notes for an example.\nFolder Created The creation of a folder always triggers indexing. The search service extracts all necessary information and stores it in the search index\nFile Created This case is similar to Folder created with the difference that a file can contain far more valuable information. This gets interesting but time-consuming when data content needs to be analyzed and indexed. Content extraction is part of the search service if configured.\nFile Version Restored Since Infinite Scale is capable of storing multiple versions of the same file, the search service also needs to take care of those versions. When a file version is restored, the service starts to extract all needed information, creates the index and makes the file discoverable.\nResource Tag Added Whenever a resource gets a new tag, the service takes care of it and makes that resource discoverable by the tag.\nResource Tag Removed This is the counterpart of Resource tag added. It takes care that a tag gets unassigned from the referenced resource.\nFile Uploaded - Synchronous This case only triggers indexing if async post processing is disabled. If so, the service starts to extract all needed file information, stores it in the index and makes it discoverable.\nFile Uploaded - Asynchronous This is exactly the same as File uploaded - synchronous with the only difference that it is used for asynchronous uploads.\nManually Trigger Re-Indexing a Space The service includes a command-line interface to trigger re-indexing a space:\nocis search index --space $SPACE_ID --user $USER_ID Note that not names but IDs are necessary and that the specified user ID needs access to the space to be indexed.\nNotes The indexing process tries to be self-healing in some situations.\nIn the following example, let\u0026rsquo;s assume a file tree foo/bar/baz exists. If the folder bar gets renamed to new-bar, the path to baz is no longer foo/bar/baz but foo/new-bar/baz. The search service checks the change and either just updates the path in the index or creates a new index for all items affected if none was present.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 # Autogenerated # Filename: search-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9224 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false grpc: addr: 127.0.0.1:9220 tls: null token_manager: jwt_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva: address: com.owncloud.api.gateway tls: mode: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; cacert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; grpc_client_tls: null events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster async_uploads: true num_consumers: 0 debounce_duration: 1000 tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; engine: type: bleve bleve: data_path: /var/lib/ocis/search extractor: type: basic cs3_allow_insecure: false tika: tika_url: http://127.0.0.1:9998 clean_stop_words: true content_extraction_size_limit: 20971520 service_account: service_account_id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; service_account_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDSEARCH_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

As an example, user profile settings that can be changed in the Web UI must be persistent.\nThe settings service supports two different backends for persisting the data. The backend can be set via the SETTINGS_STORE_TYPE environment variable. Supported values are:\nmetadata: The default. This backend persists the settings data via the storage-system service. filesystem: (deprecated) This backend persists the settings data in a directory on the local filesystem. The directory can be configured with SETTINGS_DATA_PATH. This backend is not suitable for running multiple intances of the settings service in a scale-out deployment and was therefore deprecated. Caching When using SETTINGS_STORE_TYPE=metadata, the settings service caches the results of queries against the storage backend to provide faster responses. The content of this cache is independent of the cache used in the storage-system service as it caches directory listing and settings content stored in files.\nThe store used for the cache can be configured using the SETTINGS_CACHE_STORE environment variable. Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc. Settings Management Infinite Scale services can register settings bundles with the settings service.\nSettings Usage Services can set or query Infinite Scale setting values of a user from settings bundles.\nService Accounts The settings service needs to know the IDs of service accounts but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need their secrets. They can be configured using the SETTINGS_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS_IDS envvar. When only using one service account OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID can also be used. All configured service accounts will get a hidden \u0026lsquo;service-account\u0026rsquo; role. This role contains all permissions the service account needs but will not appear calls to the list roles endpoint. It is not possible to assign the \u0026lsquo;service-account\u0026rsquo; role to a normal user.\nDefault Language The default language can be defined via the OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE environment variable. If this variable is not defined, English will be used as default. The value has the ISO 639-1 format (\u0026ldquo;de\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;en\u0026rdquo;, etc.) and is limited by the list supported languages. This setting can be used to set the default language for notification and invitation emails.\nImportant developer note: the list of supported languages is at the moment not easy defineable, as it is the minimum intersection of languages shown in the WebUI and languages defined in the ocis code for the use of notifications and userlog. Even more, not all languages where there are translations available on transifex, are available in the WebUI respectively for ocis notifications, and the translation rate for existing languages is partially not that high. You will see therefore quite often English default strings though a supported language may exist and was selected.\nThe OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE setting impacts the notification and userlog services and the WebUI. Note that translations must exist for all named components to be presented correctly.\nIf OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE is not set, the expected behavior is:\nThe notification and userlog services and the WebUI use English by default until a user sets another language in the WebUI via Account -\u0026gt; Language. If a user sets another language in the WebUI in Account -\u0026gt; Language, then the notification and userlog services and WebUI use the language defined by the user. If no translation is found, it falls back to English. If OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE is set, the expected behavior is:\nThe notification and userlog services and the WebUI use OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE by default until a user sets another language in the WebUI via Account -\u0026gt; Language. If a user sets another language in the WebUI in Account -\u0026gt; Language, the notification and userlog services and WebUI use the language defined by the user. If no translation is found, it falls back to OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE and then to English.

Though still possible to manually configure xattrs, this setting should not be used anymore as it will be removed in a later version.\nCaching The storage-system service caches file metadata via the configured store in STORAGE_SYSTEM_CACHE_STORE. Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster.

When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc.

If the setting STORAGE_USERS_OCIS_METADATA_BACKEND has not been defined manually, the backend will be migrated to messagepack automatically. Though still possible to manually configure xattrs, this setting should not be used anymore as it will be removed in a later version.\nGraceful Shutdown Starting with Infinite Scale version 3.1, you can define a graceful shutdown period for the storage-users service.\nIMPORTANT: The graceful shutdown period is only applicable if the storage-users service runs as standalone service. It does not apply if the storage-users service runs as part of the single binary or as single Docker environment. To build an environment where the storage-users service runs as a standalone service, you must start two instances, one without the storage-users service and one only with the the storage-users service. Note that both instances must be able to communicate on the same network.\nWhen hard-stopping Infinite Scale, for example with the kill \u0026lt;pid\u0026gt; command (SIGKILL), it is possible and likely that not all data from the decomposedfs (metadata) has been written to the storage which may result in an inconsistent decomposedfs. When gracefully shutting down Infinite Scale, using a command like SIGTERM, the process will no longer accept any write requests from other services and will try to write the internal open requests which can take an undefined duration based on many factors. To mitigate that situation, the following things have been implemented:\nWith the value of the environment variable STORAGE_USERS_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT, the storage-users service will delay its shutdown giving it time to finalize writing necessary data. This delay can be necessary if there is a lot of data to be saved and/or if storage access/thruput is slow. In such a case you would receive an error log entry informing you that not all data could be saved in time. To prevent such occurrences, you must increase the default value.\nIf a shutdown error has been logged, the command-line maintenance tool Inspect and Manipulate Node Metadata can help to fix the issue. Please contact support for details.\nCLI Commands Manage Unfinished Uploads When using Infinite Scale as user storage, a directory named storage/users/uploads can be found in the Infinite Scale data folder. This is an intermediate directory based on TUS which is an open protocol for resumable uploads. Each upload consists of a blob and a blob.info file. Note that the term blob is just a placeholder.\nIf an upload succeeds, the blob file will be moved to the target and the blob.info file will be deleted.\nIn case of incomplete uploads, the blob and blob.info files will continue to receive data until either the upload succeeds in time or the upload expires based on the STORAGE_USERS_UPLOAD_EXPIRATION variable, see the table below for details.\nIn case of expired uploads, the blob and blob.info files will not be removed automatically. Thus a lot of data can pile up over time wasting storage space.\nIn the rare case of a failure, after the upload succeeded but the file was not moved to its target location, which can happen when postprocessing fails, the situation is the same as with expired uploads.\nExample cases for expired uploads\nWhen a user uploads a big file but the file exceeds the user-quota, the upload can\u0026rsquo;t be moved to the target after it has finished. The file stays at the upload location until it is manually cleared. If the bandwidth is limited and the file to transfer can\u0026rsquo;t be transferred completely before the upload expiration time is reached, the file expires and can\u0026rsquo;t be processed. There are two commands available to manage unfinished uploads\nocis storage-users uploads \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; COMMANDS: list Print a list of all incomplete uploads clean Clean up leftovers from expired uploads Command Examples Command to identify incomplete uploads\nocis storage-users uploads list Incomplete uploads: - 455bd640-cd08-46e8-a5a0-9304908bd40a (file_example_PPT_1MB.ppt, Size: 1028608, Expires: 2022-08-17T12:35:34+02:00) Command to clear expired uploads\nocis storage-users uploads clean Cleaned uploads: - 455bd640-cd08-46e8-a5a0-9304908bd40a (Filename: file_example_PPT_1MB.ppt, Size: 1028608, Expires: 2022-08-17T12:35:34+02:00) Purge Expired Space Trash-Bins Items This command is about the trash-bin to get an overview of items, restore items and purging old items of project spaces (spaces that have been created manually) and personal spaces.\nocis storage-users trash-bin \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; Purge-expired COMMANDS: purge-expired Purge all expired items from the trashbin The configuration for the purge-expired command is done by using the following environment variables.\nSTORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_USER_ID is used to obtain space trash-bin information and takes the system admin user as the default which is the OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID but can be set individually. It should be noted, that the OCIS_ADMIN_USER_ID is only assigned automatically when using the single binary deployment and must be manually assigned in all other deployments. The command only considers spaces to which the assigned user has access and delete permission.\nSTORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_PERSONAL_DELETE_BEFORE has a default value of 30 days, which means the command will delete all files older than 30 days. The value is human-readable, valid values are 24h, 60m, 60s etc. 0 is equivalent to disable and prevents the deletion of personal space trash-bin files.\nSTORAGE_USERS_PURGE_TRASH_BIN_PROJECT_DELETE_BEFORE has a default value of 30 days, which means the command will delete all files older than 30 days. The value is human-readable, valid values are 24h, 60m, 60s etc. 0 is equivalent to disable and prevents the deletion of project space trash-bin files.\nList and Restore Trash-Bins Items To authenticate the cli command use OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET=\u0026lt;acc-secret\u0026gt; and OCIS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID=\u0026lt;acc-id\u0026gt;. The storage-users cli tool uses the default address to establish the connection to the gateway service. If the connection is failed check your custom gateway service GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR configuration and set the same address to storage-users variable OCIS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR or STORAGE_USERS_GATEWAY_GRPC_ADDR. The variable STORAGE_USERS_CLI_MAX_ATTEMPTS_RENAME_FILE defines a maximum number of attempts to rename a file when the user restores the file with --option keep-both to existing destination with the same name.\nThe ID sources:\npersonal \u0026lsquo;spaceID\u0026rsquo; in a https://{host}/graph/v1.0/me/drives?$filter=driveType+eq+personal project \u0026lsquo;spaceID\u0026rsquo; in a https://{host}/graph/v1.0/me/drives?$filter=driveType+eq+project NAME: ocis storage-users trash-bin list - Print a list of all trash-bin items of a space.

Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc.

It retrieves the sources at the location where the user files are stored and saves the thumbnails where system files are stored. Those locations have defaults but can be manually defined via environment variables.\nTable of Contents File Locations Overview Thumbnail Location Thumbnail Source File Types Thumbnail Target File Types Thumbnail Query String Parameters Thumbnail Resolution Thumbnail Processors Deleting Thumbnails Memory Considerations Example Yaml Config File Locations Overview The relevant environment variables defining file locations are:\n(1) OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH (2) STORAGE_USERS_OCIS_ROOT (3) THUMBNAILS_FILESYSTEMSTORAGE_ROOT (1) \u0026hellip; Having a default set by the Infinite Scale code, but if defined, used as base path for other services. (2) \u0026hellip; Source files, defaults to (1) plus path component, but can be freely defined if required. (3) \u0026hellip; Target files, defaults to (1) plus path component, but can be freely defined if required.\nFor details and defaults for these environment variables see the ocis admin documentation.\nThumbnail Location It may be beneficial to define the location of the thumbnails to be other than the default (with system files). This is due the fact that storing thumbnails can consume a lot of space over time which not necessarily needs to reside on the same partition or mount or expensive drives.\nThumbnail Source File Types Thumbnails can be generated from the following source file types:\npng jpg gif tiff bmp txt The thumbnail service retrieves source files using the information provided by the backend. The Linux backend identifies source files usually based on the extension.\nIf a file type was not properly assigned or the type identification failed, thumbnail generation will fail and an error will be logged.\nThumbnail Target File Types Thumbnails can either be generated as png, jpg or gif files. These types are hardcoded and no other types can be requested. A requestor, like another service or a client, can request one of the available types to be generated. If more than one type is required, each type must be requested individually.\nThumbnail Query String Parameters Clients can request thumbnail previews for files by adding ?preview=1 to the file URL. Requests for files with thumbnail availabe respond with HTTP status 404.\nThe following query parameters are supported:\nParameter Required Default Value Description preview YES 1 generates preview x YES first x-value configured in THUMBNAILS_RESOLUTIONS horizontal target size y YES first y-value configured in THUMBNAILS_RESOLUTIONS vertical target size scalingup NO 0 prevents upscaling of small images a NO 1 aspect ratio c NO Caching string Clients should send the etag, so they get a fresh thumbnail after a file change processor NO resize for gif\u0026rsquo;s and thumbnail for all others preferred thumbnail processor Thumbnail Resolution Various resolutions can be defined via THUMBNAILS_RESOLUTIONS. A requestor can request any arbitrary resolution and the thumbnail service will use the one closest to the requested resolution. If more than one resolution is required, each resolution must be requested individually.\nExample:\nRequested: 18x12\nAvailable: 30x20, 15x10, 9x6\nReturned: 15x10\nThumbnail Processors Normally, an image might get cropped when creating a preview, depending on the aspect ratio of the original image. This can have negative impacts on previews as only a part of the image will be shown. When using an optional processor in the request, cropping can be avoided by defining on how the preview image generation will be done. The following processors are available:\nresize resizes the image to the specified width and height and returns the transformed image. If one of width or height is 0, the image aspect ratio is preserved. fit scales down the image to fit the specified maximum width and height and returns the transformed image. fill: creates an image with the specified dimensions and fills it with the scaled source image. To achieve the correct aspect ratio without stretching, the source image will be cropped. thumbnail scales the image up or down, crops it to the specified width and hight and returns the transformed image. To apply one of those, a query parameter has to be added to the request, like ?processor=fit. If no query parameter or processor is added, the default behaviour applies which is resize for gif\u0026rsquo;s and thumbnail for all others.\nDeleting Thumbnails As of now, there is no automated thumbnail deletion. This is especially true when a source file gets deleted or moved. This situation will be solved at a later stage. For the time being, if you run short on physical thumbnails space, you have to manually delete the thumbnail store to free space. Thumbnails will then be recreated on request.\nMemory Considerations Since source files need to be loaded into memory when generating thumbnails, large source files could potentially crash this service if there is insufficient memory available. For bigger instances when using container orchestration deployment methods, this service can be dedicated to its own server(s) with more memory.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 # Autogenerated # Filename: thumbnails-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9189 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false grpc: addr: 127.0.0.1:9185 tls: null http: addr: 127.0.0.1:9186 tls: enabled: false cert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; root: /thumbnails grpc_client_tls: null thumbnail: resolutions: - 16x16 - 32x32 - 64x64 - 128x128 - 1080x1920 - 1920x1080 - 2160x3840 - 3840x2160 - 4320x7680 - 7680x4320 filesystem_storage: root_directory: /var/lib/ocis/thumbnails webdav_allow_insecure: false cs3_allow_insecure: false reva_gateway: com.owncloud.api.gateway font_map_file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; transfer_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; data_endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:9186/thumbnails/data Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDTHUMBNAILS_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

It provides an API to retrieve those.\nTable of Contents The Log Service Ecosystem Prerequisites Storing Configuring Retrieving Posting Authentication Deprovisioning Deleting Translations Translation Rules Default Language Example Yaml Config The Log Service Ecosystem Log services like the userlog, clientlog and sse are responsible for composing notifications for a certain audience.\nThe userlog service translates and adjusts messages to be human readable. The clientlog service composes machine readable messages, so clients can act without the need to query the server. The sse service is only responsible for sending these messages. It does not care about their form or language. Prerequisites Running the userlog service without running the eventhistory service is not possible.\nStoring The userlog service persists information via the configured store in USERLOG_STORE. Possible stores are:\nmemory: Basic in-memory store and the default. redis-sentinel: Stores data in a configured Redis Sentinel cluster. nats-js-kv: Stores data using key-value-store feature of nats jetstream noop: Stores nothing. Useful for testing. Not recommended in production environments. ocmem: Advanced in-memory store allowing max size. (deprecated) redis: Stores data in a configured Redis cluster. (deprecated) etcd: Stores data in a configured etcd cluster. (deprecated) nats-js: Stores data using object-store feature of nats jetstream (deprecated) Other store types may work but are not supported currently.\nNote: The service can only be scaled if not using memory store and the stores are configured identically over all instances!\nNote that if you have used one of the deprecated stores, you should reconfigure to one of the supported ones as the deprecated stores will be removed in a later version.\nStore specific notes:\nWhen using redis-sentinel, the Redis master to use is configured via e.g. OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES in the form of \u0026lt;sentinel-host\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;sentinel-port\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;redis-master\u0026gt; like 10.10.0.200:26379/mymaster. When using nats-js-kv it is recommended to set OCIS_CACHE_STORE_NODES to the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT. That way the cache uses the same nats instance as the event bus. When using the nats-js-kv store, it is possible to set OCIS_CACHE_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE to instruct nats to not persist cache data on disc. Configuring For the time being, the configuration which user related events are of interest is hardcoded and cannot be changed.\nRetrieving The userlog service provides an API to retrieve configured events. For now, this API is mostly following the oc10 notification GET API.\nPosting The userlog service is able to store global messages that will be displayed in the Web UI to all users. If a user deletes the message in the Web UI, it reappears on reload. Global messages use the endpoint /ocs/v2.php/apps/notifications/api/v1/notifications/global and are activated by sending a POST request. Note that sending another POST request of the same type overwrites the previous one. For the time being, only the type deprovision is supported.\nAuthentication POST and DELETE endpoints provide notifications to all users. Therefore only certain users can configure them. Two authentication methods for this endpoint are provided. Users with the admin role can always access these endpoints. Additionally, a static secret via the USERLOG_GLOBAL_NOTIFICATIONS_SECRET can be defined to enable access for users knowing this secret, which has to be sent with the header containing the request.\nDeprovisioning Deprovision messages announce a deprovision text including a deprovision date of the instance to all users. With this message, users get informed that the instance will be shut down and deprovisioned and no further access to their data is possible past the given date. This implies that users must download their data before the given date. The text shown to users refers to this information. Note that the task to deprovision the instance does not depend on the message. The text of the message can be translated according to the translation settings, see section Translations. The endpoint only expects a deprovision_date parameter in the POST request body as the final text is assembled automatically. The string hast to be in RFC3339 format, however, this format can be changed by using deprovision_date_format. See the go time formating for more details.\nDeleting To delete events for an user, use a DELETE request to ocs/v2.php/apps/notifications/api/v1/notifications containing the IDs to delete.\nSending a DELETE request to the ocs/v2.php/apps/notifications/api/v1/notifications/global endpoint to remove a global message is a restricted action, see the Authentication section for more details.)\nTranslations The userlog service has embedded translations sourced via transifex to provide a basic set of translated languages. These embedded translations are available for all deployment scenarios. In addition, the service supports custom translations, though it is currently not possible to just add custom translations to embedded ones. If custom translations are configured, the embedded ones are not used. To configure custom translations, the USERLOG_TRANSLATION_PATH environment variable needs to point to a base folder that will contain the translation files. This path must be available from all instances of the userlog service, a shared storage is recommended. Translation files must be of type .po or .mo. For each language, the filename needs to be userlog.po (or userlog.mo) and stored in a folder structure defining the language code. In general the path/name pattern for a translation file needs to be:\n{USERLOG_TRANSLATION_PATH}/{language-code}/LC_MESSAGES/userlog.po The language code pattern is composed of language[_territory] where language is the base language and _territory is optional and defines a country.\nFor example, for the language de, one needs to place the corresponding translation files to {USERLOG_TRANSLATION_PATH}/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/userlog.po.\nImportant: For the time being, the embedded ownCloud Web frontend only supports the main language code but does not handle any territory. When strings are available in the language code language_territory, the web frontend does not see it as it only requests language. In consequence, any translations made must exist in the requested language to avoid a fallback to the default.\nTranslation Rules If a requested language code is not available, the service tries to fall back to the base language if available. For example, if the requested language-code de_DE is not available, the service tries to fall back to translations in the de folder. If the base language de is also not available, the service falls back to the system\u0026rsquo;s default English (en), which is the source of the texts provided by the code. Default Language The default language can be defined via the OCIS_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE environment variable. See the settings service for a detailed description.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 # Autogenerated # Filename: userlog-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9210 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false http: addr: 127.0.0.1:0 root: / cors: allow_origins: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; allow_methods: - GET allow_headers: - Authorization - Origin - Content-Type - Accept - X-Requested-With - X-Request-Id - Ocs-Apirequest allow_credentials: true tls: enabled: false cert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; grpc_client_tls: null token_manager: jwt_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva_gateway: com.owncloud.api.gateway translation_path: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; default_language: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; events: endpoint: 127.0.0.1:9233 cluster: ocis-cluster tls_insecure: false tls_root_ca_certificate: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; enable_tls: false username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; persistence: store: memory nodes: [] database: userlog table: events ttl: 336h0m0s size: 0 username: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; disable_sse: false global_notifications_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; service_account: service_account_id: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; service_account_secret: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDUSERLOG_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

Therefore multiple instances of this service can be spawned in a bigger deployment like when using container orchestration with Kubernetes, without any extra configuration.\nExample Yaml Config 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 # Autogenerated # Filename: webdav-config-example.yaml tracing: enabled: false type: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; endpoint: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; collector: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; log: level: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pretty: false color: false file: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; debug: addr: 127.0.0.1:9119 token: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; pprof: false zpages: false grpc_client_tls: null http: addr: 127.0.0.1:9115 root: / cors: allow_origins: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; allow_methods: - GET - POST - PUT - PATCH - DELETE - OPTIONS allow_headers: - Authorization - Origin - Content-Type - Accept - X-Requested-With - X-Request-Id - Cache-Control allow_credentials: true tls: enabled: false cert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; disablePreviews: false ocis_public_url: https://127.0.0.1:9200 webdav_namespace: /users/{{.Id.OpaqueId}} reva_gateway: com.owncloud.api.gateway reva_gateway_tls_mode: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; reva_gateway_tls_cacert: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Environment Variables Name Type Default Value Description OCIS_TRACING_ENABLEDWEBDAV_TRACING_ENABLED bool false Activates tracing.

WebDAV is one of the central APIs that ownCloud uses for handling file resources, metadata and locks.\nWebDAV RFCs\nRFC 2518 was published in February 1999. RFC 4918, published in June 2008 obsoletes RFC 2518 with minor revisions mostly due to interoperability experience.\nCalling the WebDAV API Request URI {HTTP method} https://ocis.url/{webdav-base}/{resourceID}/{path} The request URI consists of:\nComponent Description {HTTP method} The HTTP method which is used in the request. {webdav-base} The WebDAV base path component. Possible options are dav/spaces/ This is the default and optimized endpoint for all WebDAV requests. remote.php/dav/spaces/* remote.php/webdav/* webdav/* dav/* {resourceID} This resourceID is used as the WebDAV root element. All children are accessed by their relative paths. {path} The relative path to the WebDAV root. In most of the casese, this is the space root. * these dav endpoints are implemented for legacy reasons and should not be used. Note: The legacy endpoints do not take the resourceID as an argument.\nHTTP methods Method Description PROPFIND Retrieve properties as XML from a web resource. It is also overloaded to retrieve the collection structure (a.k.a. directory hierarchy) of a remote system. PROPPATCH Process instructions specified in the request body to set and/or remove properties defined on the resource identified by the request uri. MKCOL Create a WebDAV collection (folder) at the location specified by the request uri. GET Retrieve a WebDAV resource. HEAD Retrieve a WebDAV resource without reading the body. PUT A PUT performed on an existing resource replaces the GET response entity of the resource. POST Not part of the WebDAV rfc and has no effect on a WebDAV resource. However, this method is used in the TUS protocol for uploading resources. PATCH Not part of the WebDAV rfc and has no effect on a WebDAV resource. However, this method is used in the TUS protocol for uploading resources. COPY Creates a duplicate of the source resource identified by the Request-URI, in the destination resource identified by the URI in the Destination header. MOVE The MOVE operation on a non-collection resource is the logical equivalent of a copy (COPY), followed by consistency maintenance processing, followed by a delete of the source, where all three actions are performed in a single operation. DELETE Delete the resource identified by the Request-URI. LOCK A LOCK request to an existing resource will create a lock on the resource identified by the Request-URI, provided the resource is not already locked with a conflicting lock. UNLOCK The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in the Lock-Token request header. The Request-URI must identify a resource within the scope of the lock. The methods MKCOL, GET, HEAD, LOCK, COPY, MOVE, UNLOCK and DELETE need no request body.\nThe methods PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, PUT require a request body, normally in XML format to provide the needed values.\nWebDAV is not REST\nThe WebDAV protocol was created before the REST paradigm has become the de-facto standard for API design. WebDAV uses http methods which are not part of REST. Therefore all the tooling around API design and documentation is not usable (like OpenApi 3.0 / Swagger or others).\nAuthentication For development purposes the examples in the developer documentation use Basic Auth. It is disabled by default and should only be enabled by setting PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH in the proxy for development or test instances.\nTo authenticate with a Bearer token or OpenID Connect access token replace the -u user:password Basic Auth option of curl with a -H 'Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt;' header. A \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; can be obtained by copying it from a request in the browser, although it will time out within minutes. To automatically refresh the OpenID Connect access token an ssh-agent like solution like oidc-agent should be used.\nListing Properties This method is used to list the properties of a resource in xml. This method can also be used to retrieve the listing of a WebDAV collection which means the content of a remote directory.\nCurl curl -L -X PROPFIND \u0026#39;https://localhost:9200/dav/spaces/storage-users-1%24some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000/\u0026#39; \\ -H \u0026#39;Depth: 1\u0026#39; \\ -d \u0026#39;\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:propfind xmlns:d=\u0026#34;DAV:\u0026#34; xmlns:oc=\u0026#34;http://owncloud.org/ns\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:permissions /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:favorite /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:fileid /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:owner-id /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:owner-display-name /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:share-types /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:privatelink /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getcontentlength /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:size /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getlastmodified /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getetag /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getcontenttype /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:resourcetype /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:downloadURL /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:propfind\u0026gt;\u0026#39; HTTP PROPFIND /dav/spaces/storage-users-1%24some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000/ HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:9200 Origin: https://localhost Access-Control-Request-Method: PROPFIND Depth: 1 Content-Type: application/xml Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4= Content-Length: 436 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:propfind xmlns:d=\u0026#34;DAV:\u0026#34; xmlns:oc=\u0026#34;http://owncloud.org/ns\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:permissions /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:favorite /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:fileid /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:owner-id /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:owner-display-name /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:share-types /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:privatelink /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getcontentlength /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:size /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getlastmodified /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getetag /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:getcontenttype /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;d:resourcetype /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;oc:downloadURL /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/d:propfind\u0026gt; The request consists of a request body and an optional Depth Header.\nMetadata and Directory listings\nClients can use the PROPFIND method to retrieve properties of resources (metadata) and to list the content of a directories.\nResponse 207 - Multistatus Multi Status Response A Multi-Status response conveys information about multiple resources in situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate. The default Multi-Status response body is an application/xml HTTP entity with a multistatus root element. Further elements contain 200, 300, 400, and 500 series status codes generated during the method invocation.\nAlthough 207 is used as the overall response status code, the recipient needs to consult the contents of the multistatus response body for further information about the success or failure of the method execution. The response MAY be used in success, partial success and also in failure situations.\nThe multistatus root element holds zero or more response elements in any order, each with information about an individual resource.\nBody \u0026lt;d:multistatus xmlns:s=\u0026#34;http://sabredav.org/ns\u0026#34;

You can browse the API with the Swagger UI.\nCalling the LibreGraph API {HTTP method} https://ocis.url/graph/{version}/{resource}?{query-parameters} The request component consists of:\nComponent Description {HTTP method} The HTTP method which is used in the request. {version} The version of the LibreGraph API used by the client. {resource} The LibreGraph Resource which the client is referencing in the request. {query-parameters} Optional parameters for the request to customize the response. HTTP methods Method Description GET Read data from a resource. POST Create a new resource. PATCH Update an existing resource. PUT Replace an existing resource. DELETE Delete an existing resource. The methods GET and DELETE need no request body. The methods POST, PATCH and PUT require a request body, normally in JSON format to provide the needed values.\nVersion Infinite Scale currently provides the version v1.0.\nResource A resource could be an entity or a complex type and is usually defined by properties. Entities are always recognizable by an Id property. The URL contains the resource which you are interacting with e.g. /me/drives or /groups/{group-id}.\nEach resource could possibly require different permissions. Usually you need permissions on a higher level for creating or updating an existing resource than for reading.\nQuery parameters Query parameters can be OData system query options, or other strings that a method accepts to customize its response.\nYou can use optional OData system query options to include more or fewer properties than the default response, filter the response for items that match a custom query, or provide additional parameters for a method.\nFor example, adding the following filter parameter restricts the drives returned to only those with the driveType property of project.\nGET https://ocis.url/graph/v1.0/drives?$filter=driveType eq \u0026#39;project\u0026#39; For more information about OData query options please check the API specification and the provided examples.\nAuthorization For development purposes the examples in the developer documentation use Basic Auth. It is disabled by default and should only be enabled by setting PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH in the proxy for development or test instances.\nTo authenticate with a Bearer token or OpenID Connect access token replace the -u user:password Basic Auth option of curl with a -H 'Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt;' header. A \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; can be obtained by copying it from a request in the browser, although it will time out within minutes.

The certificate is stored in idm/ldap.crt inside the oCIS base data directory. The key is in idm/ldap.key in the same directory. You can use a custom server certificate by setting the IDM_LDAPS_CERT and IDM_LDAPS_KEY.\nDefault / Demo Users On startup IDM creates a set of default services users that are needed internally to provide access to IDM to other oCIS services. These users are stored in a separate subtree. The base DN of that subtree is: ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm. The service users are:\nuid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm: This is the only user with write access to the LDAP tree. It is used by the Graph service to look up, create, delete and modify users and groups. uid=idp,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm: This user is used by the IDP service to perform user lookups for authentication. uid=reva,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm: This user is used by the \u0026ldquo;reva\u0026rdquo; services user, group and auth-basic. IDM is also able to create Demo Users upon startup.\nAccess via LDAP command line tools For testing purposes it is sometimes helpful to query IDM using the ldap command line clients. To e.g. list all users, this command can be used:\nldapsearch -x -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:9235 -x -D uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm -w idm -b o=libregraph-idm objectclass=inetorgperson When using the default configuration with the self-signed server certificate, you might need to switch off the certificate validation using the LDAPTL_REQCERT env variable:\nLDAPTLS_REQCERT=never ldapsearch -x -H ldaps://127.0.0.1:9235 -x -D uid=libregraph,ou=sysusers,o=libregraph-idm -w idm -b o=libregraph-idm objectclass=inetorgperson ","description":"TLS Server Certificates By default IDM generates a self-signed certificate and key on first startup to be able to provide TLS protected services.

List all spaces GET /drives Returns a list of all available spaces, even ones where the acting user is not a regular member of. You need elevated permissions to do list all spaces. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the elevated permissions, the result is the same like GET /me/drives.\nThe ownCloud spaces concept draws a strict line between users which can work with the content of a space and others who have the permission to manage the space. A user which is able to manage quota and space metadata does not necessarily need to be able to access the content of a space.\nSpace Admin\nThere is a global user role \u0026ldquo;Space Admin\u0026rdquo; which grants users some global permissions to manage space quota and some space metadata. This Role enables the user also to disable, restore and delete spaces. He cannot manage space members.\nSpace Manager\nThe \u0026ldquo;Space Manager\u0026rdquo; is a user which is a regular member of a space because he has been invited. In addition to being part of a space the user can also manage the memberships of the space.\nList My Spaces GET /me/drives Returns a list of all spaces where the user is a regular member of.\nRequest curl -L -k -X GET 'https://localhost:9200/graph/v1.0/me/drives/' Response - 200 OK { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;driveAlias\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;personal/admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;driveType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;personal\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;storage-users-1$some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastModifiedDateTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-01-17T21:37:17.692033183+01:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Admin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;owner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;quota\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;remaining\u0026#34;: 4497686528, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;normal\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;total\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;used\u0026#34;: 0 }, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;eTag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;4b65d2cbce79b2ecc45f876cc6e460d8\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;storage-users-1$some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webDavUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://localhost:9200/dav/spaces/storage-users-1$some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;webUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://localhost:9200/f/storage-users-1$some-admin-user-id-0000-000000000000\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;driveAlias\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;virtual/shares\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;driveType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;virtual\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668$a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Shares\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;quota\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;remaining\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;state\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;exceeded\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;total\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;used\u0026#34;: 0 }, \u0026#34;root\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;eTag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DECAFC00FEE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668$a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;webDavUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://localhost:9200/dav/spaces/a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668$a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;webUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://localhost:9200/f/a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668$a0ca6a90-a365-4782-871e-d44447bbc668\u0026#34; } ] } List my spaces with filters GET /me/drives/$filter=\u0026lt;attribute\u0026gt; \u0026lt;comparison operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt; Returns a list of all project spaces where the user is a regular member of.

Because of that, it is not possible at the moment to do any kind of easy theming and including custom theme means again compiling custom assets.\nCustomizing assets Depending on what changes you wish to do with the theme, there are several files you can edit.

To include any custom styles on top of that collection, you can define them in the idp/ui/src/app.css file.

If adding new locale, make sure to add it also in the index.js file in the same folder.\nBuilding assets In order to build all assets, run pnpm build in the idp folder. This script will compile all assets and output them into idp/assets folder.\nAt this point, you have two possible ways how to deploy your new theme:\nrun make generate in the root folder of your oCIS clone and generate the new assets start the IDP service directly with custom assets by specifying the env var IDP_ASSET_PATH ","description":"Intro Customizing assets Static assets CSS Containers What pages to theme Components Images Locales Building assets Intro Our default IDP UI is built with the LibreGraph Connect React app. Even though this app comes already with a simple theming options, we have compiled our own edited version of the app with more advanced changes than the default theming offers.

We currently pass the owner or manager of a space in events which allows the search service to impersonate that user to extract metadata from the changed resource. There are two problems with this:\nThe service could get all permissions of the user and gain write permission There is a race condition where the user in the event might no longer have read permission, causing the index to go stale The race condition will become more of an issue when we start working on a workflow engine.\nHow can we grant services the least amount of permissions required for their purpose?\nDecision Drivers It should be possible to represent this as servicePrincipals in the libregraph API, similar to the MS Graph servicePrincipal. Services should check permissions using the oCIS permissions or reva auth service, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to introduce a new mechanism for this Considered Options Service Accounts Impersonate Space-Owners Decision Outcome Chosen option: Service Accounts\nConsequences Good, because it allows provisioning permissions for services Good, because it uses existing CS3 concepts Good, because it uses the existing permissions service Good, because it can be mapped to libre graph permissions Bad, because we have to make the reva auth manager aware of CS3 USER_TYPE_SERVICE Bad, because we have to provision and manage service accounts on init Bad, because external APIs may need to filter out service accounts Bad, because we need to persist service accounts in addition to normal user accounts Pros and Cons of the Options Service Accounts Make the reva auth manager and registry aware of CS3 users of type USER_TYPE_SERVICE. Then we can provision service accounts at oCIS initialization and use the permissions service to check permissions. When assigning permissions we use the permission constraints to define the scope of permissions, see Permission Checks for more details.\nTo authenticate service accounts the static reva auth registry needs to be configured with a new auth provider for type service. The actual provider can use a plain JSON file or JSONCS3 that is provisioned once with ocis init. TODO Furthermore, the user provider needs to be able to return users for service accounts.\nGood, because we could replace machine auth with specific service accounts and no longer have to distribute a shared secret everywhere Bad, because we don\u0026rsquo;t know if a there are places in the code that try to look up a user with USER_TYPE_SERVICE at the cs3 users service \u0026hellip; they might not exist there \u0026hellip; or do we have to implement a userregistry, similar to the authregistry? Bad, because we have to provision and manage service accounts on init Bad, because we have to write code to manage service accounts or at least filter them out in the admin ui Impersonate Space-Owners We could implement a new auth manager that can authenticate space owners, a CS3 user type we introduced for project spaces which \u0026lsquo;have no owner\u0026rsquo;, only one or more managers.\nGood, because it reuses the space owner user type Bad, because the space owner always has write permission Bad, because we don\u0026rsquo;t know if a there are places in the code that try to look up a user with USER_TYPE_SPACE_OWNER at the cs3 users service \u0026hellip; they might not exist there \u0026hellip; or do we have to implement a userregistry, similar to the authregistry? Bad, because it feels like another hack and does not protect against compromised services that try to execute operations that the user did not consent to. Links MS Graph servicePrincipal reva auth managers - lacks docs for auth_machine, to be found in the code Permission checks When checking permissions we do not check for global permissions but for the concrete permission. Global permissions describe permissions that are used when assigning permissions, e.g. the index service account has the read permission constrained to tenant. The concrete permission check always contains a resource and a specific permission like Resource.Read or Space.Delete. That we currently check if a user has the delete-all-spaces permission is wrong. It should instead check if the user has the permission Space.Delete on a specific space. The permissions service can implement the check by taking the permission constraint into account.\nAnother example would be a Resource.Read check for a specific resource. Normal users like the demo users Einstein and Marie would have the permission Resource.ReadWrite with the constraint ALL (which limits them to all files they own and that have been shared with them). The permissions service can return true. Service accounts like the indexer would have Resource.Read with the constraint TENANT and thus be granted read access to all resources.\nIn the storage drive implementation we can check the ACLs first (which would allow service accounts that are known to the underlying storage system, e.g. EOS to access the resource) and then make a call to the permissions service. At least for the Read Resource permission. Other permission checks can be introduced as needed.\nThe permission names and constraints are different from the MS Graph API. Giving permission like Files.ReadWrite.All a different meaning, depending on the type of user (for normal users it means all files they have access to, for service accounts it means all files in the organization) is a source of confusion which only gets worse when there are two different UUIDs for this.\n","description":"Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @C0rby Date: 2023-01-18 Context and Problem Statement There are three levels of security checks in a microservice web application that uses OpenID Connect:\nscope claims limit the possible operations to what the user (or admin on behalf of the organization) consented to service authorization limit the possible operations to what specific services are allowed to do, on behalf of users or even without them permission checks limit the possible operations to the relationships between subject, permission and resource allow This ADR deals with a prerequisite for service authorization: service accounts."},{"id":157,"href":"/ocis/adr/0022-sharing-and-space-management-api/","title":"22.

It provides with a framework in which to run distributed systems.\nKubernetes provides you with:\nService discovery and load balancing: Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable. Storage orchestration: Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more. Automated rollouts and rollbacks: You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers and adopt all their resources to the new container. Automatic bin packing: You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources. Self-healing: Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don\u0026rsquo;t respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve. Secret and configuration management: Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration. extracted from k8s docs\nIf that is still too abstract, here is an ELI5 writeup.\nReferences and further reads Marcel Wunderlich\u0026rsquo;s 4 series articles on Kubernetes clarifying its declarative nature, deep diving into ingress networking, storage and monitoring. How does oCIS fit in the Kubernetes model oCIS was designed with running on Kubernetes in mind. We set up to adopt the Twelve-Factor App principles regarding configuration, with almost every aspect of oCIS being modifiable via environment variables. This comes in handy when you especially have a look at how a helm chart\u0026rsquo;s (we will introduce this concept shortly) list of values looks like.\nWhat is Minikube Minikube lets you run a Kubernetes cluster locally. It is the most approachable way to test a deployment. It requires no extra configuration on any cloud platform, as everything runs on your local machine. For the purpose of these docs, this is the first approach we chose to run oCIS and will develop on how to set it up.\nWhat is kubectl kubectl is the command-line tool for Kubernetes. It allows users to run commands against a k8s cluster the user has access to. It supports for having multiple contexts for as many clusters as you have access to. In these docs we will setup 2 contexts, a minikube and a GCP context.\nWhat are Helm Charts, and why they are useful for oCIS Helm is the equivalent of a package manager for Kubernetes. It can be described as a layer on top of how you would write pods, deployments or any other k8s resource declaration.\nInstalling Helm Follow the official installation guide.\nSetting up Minikube For a guide on how to set minikube up follow the official minikube start guide for your specific OS.\noCIS charts We have not yet published the oCIS Helm charts, therefore you need to clone the git repository manually. It currently also does not support to be run on Kind or Minikube clusters.

This docker compose stack contains all the backend and testing related infrastructure that is needed for an out-of-the-box usable localhost development setup, as described in the tooling section.\ndocs Folder Within the /docs folder you will find all the documentation source documents that get published to the dev docs.\npackages Folder We\u0026rsquo;re using the ownCloud Web repo as a mono repo. It contains a variety of packages. Some of them get published to npmjs.com, others define the core packages, apps and extensions that are the foundation of the ownCloud Web release artifact.\nHaving these packages side by side within the /packages folder of the repo is possible because of a pnpm feature called Workspaces. You can learn more about that by visiting the pnpm docs.\ntests Folder For historic reasons, there are two end-to-end test collections in the ownCloud Web project. The older one lives in /tests/acceptance, using Nightwatch.js. The newer one lives in /tests/e2e, using Playwright. We\u0026rsquo;re slowly moving away from the nightwatch.js-based e2e tests. As our coverage with playwright based e2e tests grows continuously, it might happen that you will not find the /tests/acceptance folder anymore. If that\u0026rsquo;s the case at the time of reading this, those are happy times. You\u0026rsquo;re more than welcome to make a pull request and adjust this section of the docs accordingly. :-)\nThe rest of the folder contains helpers and configuration files for our automated testing infrastructure.\nYou can read more about testing in our testing section\npackage.json File This is probably no surprise: the root level package.json file defines the project information, build scripts, dependencies and some more details. Each package in /packages can and most likely will contain another package.json which does the same for the respective package.\nvite.config.ts We\u0026rsquo;re working with Vite as a local development server and build tool. vite.config.ts is the main configuration file for that.

Code Style and Build Config Some of our packages in /packages are pure helper packages which ensure a common code style and build configuration for all our internal (mono repo) and external packages. We encourage you to make use of the very same packages. This helps the community understand code more easily, even when coming from different developers or vendors in the ownCloud Web ecosystem.\nNamely those packages are\n/packages/babel-preset /packages/eslint-config /packages/extension-sdk /packages/prettier-config /packages/tsconfig/ ownCloud Design System The ownCloud Design System (/packages/design-system) is a collection of components, design tokens and styles which ensure a unique and consistent look and feel and branding throughout the ownCloud Web ecosystem. We hope that you use it, too, so that your very own apps and extensions will blend in with all the others. Documentation and code examples can be found in the design system documentation.\nThe ownCloud Design System is a standalone project, but to make development easier we have the code in our mono repo. We\u0026rsquo;re planning to publish it on npmjs.com as @ownclouders/design-system as soon as possible. Since it\u0026rsquo;s bundled with ownCloud Web, you should not bundle it with your app or extension.\nweb-client The client package (/packages/web-client) serves as an abstraction layer for the various ownCloud APIs, like LibreGraph, WebDAV and OCS. The package provides TypeScript interfaces for various entities (like files, folders, shares and spaces) and makes sure that raw API responses are properly transformed so that you can deal with more useful objects. The web-client package gets published on npmjs.com as @ownclouders/web-client.\nDedicated documentation for the web-client package is not available, yet, since our extension system is still work in progress.\nweb-pkg The web-pkg package (/packages/web-pkg) is a collection of opinionated components, composables, types and other helpers that aim at making your app and extension developer experience as easy and seamless as possible. The web-pkg package gets published on npmjs.com as @ownclouders/web-pkg.\nDedicated documentation for the web-pkg package is not available, yet, since our extension system is still work in progress.\nweb-runtime At the very heart of ownCloud Web, the web-runtime is responsible for dependency injection, app bootstrapping, configuration, authentication, data preloading and much more. It is very likely that you will never get in touch with it as most of the developer-facing features are exposed via web-pkg. If you have more questions about this package, please join our public chat and simply ask or write an issue in our issue tracker.\nStandalone Core Apps Both web-app-admin-settings and web-app-files are standalone apps which are bundled with the default ownCloud Web release artifact.\nViewer and Editor Apps Apps which fall into the categories viewer or editor can be opened from the context of a file or folder. This mostly happens from within the files app. We currently bundle the following apps with the default ownCloud Web release artifact:\nweb-app-draw-io an editor for .drawio files web-app-external an iframe integration of all the apps coming from the app provider (e.g. OnlyOffice, Collabora Online and others) web-app-pdf-viewer a viewer for .pdf files, which relies on native PDF rendering support from the browser web-app-preview a viewer for various media files (audio / video / image formats) web-app-text-editor a simple editor for .txt, .md and other plain text files If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in writing your own viewer or editor app for certain file types, please get in touch with us for more info.\n","description":"Repository Structure dev Folder and docker-compose.yml File docs Folder packages Folder tests Folder package.json File vite.config.ts (Published) Packages Code Style and Build Config ownCloud Design System web-client web-pkg web-runtime Standalone Core Apps Viewer and Editor Apps Repository Structure From a developer\u0026rsquo;s perspective, the most important parts of the ownCloud Web repo are the following files and folders:\ndev Folder and docker-compose.yml File The /dev folder contains all the configuration files that are needed in the docker-compose."},{"id":173,"href":"/ocis/storage-backends/cephfs/","title":"cephfs","parent":"Storage backends","content":" Development Architecture Implemented Aspects Future work oCIS intends to make the aspects of existing storage systems available as transparently as possible, but the static sync algorithm of the desktop client relies on some form of recursive change time propagation on the server side to detect changes. While this can be bolted on top of existing file systems with inotify, the kernel audit or a fuse based overlay filesystem, a storage system that already implements this aspect is preferable. Aside from EOS, cephfs supports a recursive change time that oCIS can use to calculate an etag for the webdav API.\nDevelopment The cephfs development happens in a Reva branch and is currently driven by CERN.\nArchitecture In the original approach the driver was based on the localfs driver, relying on a locally mounted cephfs. It would interface with it using the POSIX apis. This has been changed to directly call the Ceph API using https://github.com/ceph/go-ceph. It allows using the ceph admin APIs to create sub-volumes for user homes and maintain a file id to path mapping using symlinks.\nImplemented Aspects The recursive change time built ino cephfs is used to implement the etag propagation expected by the ownCloud clients. This allows oCIS to pick up changes that have been made by external tools, bypassing any oCIS APIs.\nLike other filesystems cephfs uses inodes and like most other filesystems inodes are reused. To get stable file identifiers the current cephfs driver assigns every node a file id and maintains a custom fileid to path mapping in a system directory:\n/tmp/cephfs $ tree -a . ├── reva │ └── einstein │ ├── Pictures │ └── welcome.txt └── .reva_hidden ├── .fileids │ ├── 50BC39D364A4703A20C58ED50E4EADC3_570078 -\u0026gt; /tmp/cephfs/reva/einstein │ ├── 571EFB3F0ACAE6762716889478E40156_570081 -\u0026gt; /tmp/cephfs/reva/einstein/Pictures │ └── C7A1397524D0419B38D04D539EA531F8_588108 -\u0026gt; /tmp/cephfs/reva/einstein/welcome.txt └── .uploads Versions are not file but snapshot based, a native feature of cephfs. The driver maps entries in the native cephfs .snap folder to the CS3 api recycle bin concept and makes them available in the web UI using the versions sidebar. Snapshots can be triggered by users themselves or on a schedule.\nTrash is not implemented, as cephfs has no native recycle bin and instead relies on the snapshot functionality that can be triggered by end users. It should be possible to automatically create a snapshot before deleting a file. This needs to be explored.\nShares are mapped to ACLs supported by cephfs. The share manager is used to persist the intent of a share and can be used to periodically verify or reset the ACLs on cephfs.\nFuture work The spaces concept matches cephfs sub-volumes. We can implement the CreateStorageSpace call with that, keep track of the list of storage spaces using symlinks, like for the id based lookup. The share manager needs a persistence layer. Currently we persist using a single json file. As it basically provides two lists, shared with me and shared with others, we could persist them directly on cephfs! If needed for redundancy, the share manager can be run multiple times, backed by the same cephfs To save disk io the data can be cached in memory, and invalidated using stat requests. A good tradeoff would be a folder for each user with a json file for each list. That way, we only have to open and read a single file when the user want\u0026rsquo;s to list the shares. To allow deprovisioning a user the data should be sharded by userid. That way all share information belonging to a user can easily be removed from the system. If necessary it can also be restored easily by copying the user specific folder back in place. For consistency over metadata any file blob data, backups can be done using snapshots.

The Decomposed FS can be set up to run on a NFS share. That way the same storage can be provided over the network to other nodes running oCIS.\nThis document summarizes a few important considerations of the NFS setup and describes a tested setup. The test has not covered concurrent access of data from different nodes yet.\nNFS Server Setup This document covers the linux kernel NFS server on a standard Linux running on x86_64.\nThe NFS server needs to be set up in a way that it supports extended file attributes.\nExtended attributes are supported by NFS starting with Kernel version 5.9, which means that the server with the NFS server has to run a kernel with that or a higher version number. To check that, run the command uname -a on the NFS server and compare the displayed version number.\nThe NFS server in the test setup was configured with the following line in the config file /etc/exports:\n/space/nfstest 192.168.178.0/24(rw,root_squash,async,subtree_check,anonuid=0,anongid=100,all_squash)\nThis exports the directory /space/nfstest to the internal network with certain options.\nImportant:\nThe share needs to be exported with the async option for proper NFS performance. NFS Client Mount The nodes that run oCIS need to mount the NFS storage to a local mount point.\nThe test setup uses the client mount command: mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4 192.168.178.28:/space/nfstest /mnt/ocisdata/\nIt sets the NFS version to 4, which is important to support extended attributes.\nAfter successfully mounting the storage on the client, it can be checked if the NFS setup really supports extended attributes properly using the following commands.\nsetfattr -n user.test -v \u0026quot;xattr test string\u0026quot; ocisdata/foo to write an extended attribute to a file, and getfattr -d ocisdata/foo to list all the attributes a file has set.\nThe NFS server setup can be optimized considering system administrative-, performance- and security options. This is not (yet) covered in this documentation. oCIS Start using the NFS Share The oCIS server can be instructed to set up the decomposed FS at a certain path by setting the environment variable OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH.\nThe test setup started an oCIS tech preview single binary release using this start command:\n./ocis init OCIS_BASE_DATA_PATH=/mnt/ocisdata/ OCIS_LOG_LEVEL=debug OCIS_INSECURE=true PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9200 OCIS_URL=https://hostname:9200 ./ocis server This starts oCIS and a decomposed FS skeleton file system structure is set up on the NFS share.\nThe oCIS instance is passing a smoke test.\n","description":"NFS Server Setup NFS Client Mount oCIS Start using the NFS Share oCIS\u0026rsquo; default storage backend is the Decomposed FS. The Decomposed FS can be set up to run on a NFS share. That way the same storage can be provided over the network to other nodes running oCIS.\nThis document summarizes a few important considerations of the NFS setup and describes a tested setup. The test has not covered concurrent access of data from different nodes yet."},{"id":176,"href":"/architecture/efficient-stat-polling/","title":"Efficient Stat Polling","parent":"Architecture","content":"The fallback sync mechanism uses the ETag to determine which part of a sync tree needs to be checked by recursively descending into folders whose ETag has changed. The ETag can be calculated using a stat() call in the filesystem and we are going to explore how many stat() calls are necessary and how the number might be reduced.\nETag propagation What does ETag propagation mean? Whenever a file changes its content or metadata the ETag or \u0026ldquo;entity tag\u0026rdquo; changes. In the early days of ownCloud it was decided to extend this behavior to folders as well, which is outside of any WebDAV RFC specification. Nevertheless, here we are, using the ETag to reflect changes, not only on WebDAV resources but also WebDAV collections. The server will propagate the ETag change up to the root of the tree.\ngraph TD linkStyle default interpolate basis subgraph final ETag propagation ert3(( etag:N )) --- el3(( etag:O )) \u0026 er3(( etag:N )) er3 --- erl3(( etag:O )) \u0026 err3(( etag:N )) end subgraph first ETag propagation ert2(( etag:O )) --- el2(( etag:O )) \u0026 er2(( etag:N )) er2 --- erl2(( etag:O )) \u0026 err2(( etag:N )) end subgraph initial file change ert(( etag:O )) --- el(( etag:O )) \u0026 er(( etag:O )) er --- erl(( etag:O )) \u0026 err(( etag:N )) end The old etag:O is replaced by propagating the new etag:N up to the root, where the client will pick it up and explore the tree by comparing the old ETags known to him with the state of the current ETags on the server. This form of sync is called state based sync.\nSingle user sync To let the client detect changes in the drive (a tree of files and folders) of a user, we rely on the ETag of every node in the tree. The discovery phase starts at the root of the tree and checks if the ETag has changed since the last discovery:\nif it is still the same nothing has changed inside the tree if it changed the client will compare the ETag of all immediate children and recursively descend into every node that changed This works, because the server side will propagate ETag changes in the tree up to the root.\ngraph TD linkStyle default interpolate basis ec( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|ert subgraph ert(( )) --- el(( )) \u0026 er(( )) er --- erl(( )) \u0026 err(( )) end Multiple users On an ocis server there is not one user but many. Each of them may have one or more clients running. In the worst case all of them polling the ETag of his home root node every 30 seconds.\nKeep in mind that etags are only propagated inside each distinct tree. No sharing is considered yet.\ngraph TD linkStyle default interpolate basis ec( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|ert subgraph ert(( )) --- el(( )) \u0026 er(( )) er --- erl(( )) \u0026 err(( )) end mc( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|mrt subgraph mrt(( )) --- ml(( )) \u0026 mr(( )) mr --- mrl(( )) \u0026 mrr(( )) end fc( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|frt subgraph frt(( )) --- fl(( )) \u0026 fr(( )) fr --- frl(( )) \u0026 frr(( )) end Sharing Storage providers are responsible for persisting shares as close to the storage as possible.\nOne implementation may persist shares using ACLs, another might use custom extended attributes. The chosen implementation is storage specific and always a tradeoff between various requirements. Yet, the goal is to treat the storage provider as the single source of truth for all metadata.\nIf users can bypass the storage provider using e.g. ssh additional mechanisms needs to make sure no inconsistencies arise:\nthe ETag must still be propagated in a tree, eg using inotify, a policy engine or workflows triggered by other means deleted files should land in the trash (e.g. rm could be wrapped to move files to trash) overwriting files should create a new version \u0026hellip; other than a fuse fs I see no way of providing this for normal posix filesystems. Other storage backends that use the s3 protocol might provide versions natively. The storage provider is also responsible for keeps track of references e.g. using a shadow tree that users normally cannot see or representing them as symbolic links in the filesystem (Beware of symbolic link cycles. The clients are currently unaware of them and would flood the filesystem).\nTo prevent write amplification ETags must not propagate across references. When a file that was shared by einstein changes the ETag must not be propagated into any share recipients tree.\ngraph TD linkStyle default interpolate basis ec( einsteins client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|ert subgraph ml --- mlr(( )) mrt(( )) --- ml(( )) \u0026 mr(( )) mr --- mrl(( )) \u0026 mrr(( )) end mlr -. reference .-\u003e er subgraph ert(( )) --- el(( )) \u0026 er(( )) er --- erl(( )) \u0026 err(( )) end mc( maries client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|mrt But how can Marie\u0026rsquo;s client detect the change?\nWe are trading writes for reads: the client needs to stat the own tree \u0026amp; all shares or entry points into other storage trees.\nIt would require client changes that depend on the server side actually having an endpoint that can efficiently list all entry points into storages a user has access to including their current etag.\nBut having to list n storages might become a bottleneck anyway, so we are going to have the gateway calculate a virtual root ETag for all entry points a user has access to and cache that.\nServer Side Stat Polling Every client polls the virtual root ETag (every 30 sec). The gateway will cache the virtual root ETag of every storage for 30 sec as well. That way every storage provider is only stated once every 30 sec (can be throttled dynamically to adapt to storage io load).\ngraph TD linkStyle default interpolate basis ec( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|evr subgraph gateway caching virtual etags evr(( )) mvr(( )) fvr(( )) end evr --- ert mvr --- mrt fvr --- frt subgraph ert(( )) --- el(( )) \u0026 er(( )) er --- erl(( )) \u0026 err(( )) end mc( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|mvr subgraph mrt(( )) --- ml(( )) \u0026 mr(( )) ml --- mlm(( )) mr --- mrl(( )) \u0026 mrr(( )) end mlm -.- er mvr -.- er fc( client ) --\u003e|\"stat()\"|fvr subgraph frt(( )) --- fl(( )) \u0026 fr(( )) fr --- frl(( )) \u0026 frr(( )) end Since the active clients will poll the etag for all active users the gateway will have their ETag cached. This is where sharing comes into play: The gateway also needs to stat the ETag of all other entry points \u0026hellip; or mount points. That may increase the number of stat like requests to storage providers by an order of magnitude.\nRam considerations For a single machine using a local posix storage the linux kernel already caches the inodes that contain the metadata that is necessary to calculate the ETag (even extended attributes are supported). With 4k inodes 256 nodes take 1Mb of RAM, 1k inodes take 4Mb and 1M inodes take 4Gb to completely cache the file metadata. For distributed filesystems a dedicated cache might make sense to prevent hammering it with stat like requests to calculate ETags.\nBandwidth considerations The bandwidth for a single machine might be another bottleneck. Consider a propfind request with roughly 500 bytes and a response with roughly 800 bytes in size:\nAt 100Mbit (~10Mb/s) you can receive 20 000 PROPFIND requests At 1000Mbit (~100Mb/s) you can receive 200 000 PROPFIND requests At 10Gbit (~1Gb/s) you can receive 2 000 000 PROPFIND requests This can be scaled by adding more gateways and sharding users because these components are stateless.\nShare mount point polling cache What can we do to reduce the number of stat calls to storage providers. Well, the gateway queries the share manager for all mounted shares of a user (or all entry points, not only the users own root/home). The share references contain the storage provider that contains the share. If every user has its own storage provider id the gateway could check in its own cache if the storage root etag has changed. It will be up-to-date because another client likely already polled for its etag. This would reduce the number of necessary stat requests to active storages.\nActive share node cache invalidation We can extend the lifetime of share ETag cache entries and only invalidate them when the root of the storage that contains them changes its ETag. That would reduce the number of stat requests to the number of active users.\nPush notifications We can further enhance this by sending push notifications when the root of a storage changes. Which is becoming increasingly necessary for mobile devices anyway.\n","description":"The fallback sync mechanism uses the ETag to determine which part of a sync tree needs to be checked by recursively descending into folders whose ETag has changed.

Therefore you need to navigate to the subdirectory ocis and start the build process.\ncd ocis make build After the build process finished, you can find the binary within the bin/ folder (in ocis/bin relative to the oCIS repository root folder).\nTry to run it: ./bin/ocis h\nBuild a local oCIS docker image If you are developing and want to run your local changes in a docker or docker-compose setup, you have to build an image locally.\nTherefore run following commands in the root of the oCIS repository:\ndocker build -t owncloud/ocis:dev . Then you can test as usual via\ndocker run --rm -ti owncloud/ocis:dev ","description":"Build requirements Get the sources Build the oCIS binary Build a local oCIS docker image Build requirements see Development - Getting Started\nGet the sources git clone https://github.com/owncloud/ocis.git cd ocis Build the oCIS binary You only need to run following command if you have changed protobuf definitions or the frontend part in one of the extensions.

Creation and upload of files does not work Uploading big files appears to hang Running out of space quickly oCIS can be configured to run on top of eos. While the eos documentation does cover a lot of topics, it leaves out some details that you may have to either pull from various docker containers, the forums or even the source itself.\nThis document is a work in progress of the current setup.\nDocker dev environment for eos storage We begin with the docker-compose.yml found in https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/tree/master/ocis/ and switch it to eos-storage.\n1. Start eos \u0026amp; ocis containers Start the eos cluster and ocis via the compose stack.\ndocker-compose up -d The first time the ocis container starts up, it will compile ocis from scratch which can take a while. To follow progress, run docker-compose logs -f --tail=10 ocis 2. LDAP support Configure the OS to resolve users and groups using ldap\ndocker-compose exec -d ocis /start-ldap Check that the OS in the ocis container can now resolve einstein or the other demo users\n$ docker-compose exec ocis id einstein uid=20000(einstein) gid=30000(users) groups=30000(users),30001(sailing-lovers),30002(violin-haters),30007(physics-lovers) If the user is not found at first you might need to wait a few more minutes in case the ocis container is still compiling. We also need to restart the storage-userprovider service, so it picks up the changed environment. Without a restart it is not able to resolve users from LDAP.\ndocker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill storage-userprovider docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis run storage-userprovider 3. Home storage Kill the home storage. By default it uses the ocis storage driver. We need to switch it to the eoshome driver:\ndocker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill storage-home docker-compose exec -e STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eoshome ocis ./bin/ocis run storage-home 4. Users storage Kill the users storage. By default it uses the ocis storage driver. We need to switch it to the eos driver:\ndocker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill storage-users docker-compose exec -e STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER=eos ocis ./bin/ocis run storage-users 5. Metadata storage First we need to create the metadata root in eos and set an owner:\ndocker-compose exec ocis eos mkdir -p /eos/dockertest/ocis/metadata docker-compose exec ocis eos chown 2:2 /eos/dockertest/ocis/metadata The uid and gid 2 are referencing the user daemon inside the ocis container. That user is also configured when restarting the accounts service later. For production systems you should create a dedicated user for the metadata storage. Kill the metadata storage. By default it uses the ocis storage driver. We need to switch it to the eos driver:\ndocker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill storage-system docker-compose exec -e STORAGE_SYSTEM_DRIVER=eos -e STORAGE_SYSTEM_ROOT=/eos/dockertest/ocis/metadata ocis ./bin/ocis run storage-system 6. Accounts service Kill the accounts service. By default it uses the ocis storage driver.

Then delete the local \u0026ldquo;bin\u0026rdquo; folder as root which contains the ocis binaries compiled by the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; docker.\nTroubleshooting Docker-compose exits right away When running docker-compose up -d ocis exits right away.\nYou can check the error code using docker-compose ps and investigate further by running only ocis again using docker-compose up ocis (without -d so you can see what is going on in the foreground). One reason might be that the binary was already built but does not match the container env. Try running make clean before running docker-compose up ocis so it gets built inside the container.\nWhere are the logs ? The ocis logs can be accessed using docker-compose logs ocis. Add -f for following.\nHow do I update a service in the ocis container? docker-compose exec ocis make clean build to update the binary docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill \u0026lt;service\u0026gt; to kill the service docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis run \u0026lt;service\u0026gt; to start the service.

In case the default space appears as offline, run docker-compose exec mgm-master eos space set default on.\nUploading big files appears to hang Please note that the uploads first go into the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; docker and land in its \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; folder, then gets copied over to the EOS docker using xrdcopy. This is why uploading first transfers all bytes and then seem to hang for a while during the final copy.\nRunning out of space quickly The EOS dockers are configured with replication, so every file uploaded there will be replicated 4 times, so make sure there is enough physical space on disk when testing.\nAlso please note that older failed uploads might still be present in the \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; directory of the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; container.\n","description":"Docker dev environment for eos storage 1.

Derive from these examples, be creative, do unusual and unconventional things, to try to break things.\nOne option to create new test-cases and to stress the system is to examine what the API acceptance-tests or the web-UI does, examine the requests and do something a bit different with curl. This is also a good way to find out how APIs work that are not already fully documented.\nSome cases have suggested setup steps, but feel free to use other setups. This can include:\ndifferent deployment methods (e.g. running single binary, docker-container, docker-compose setup, individual services in own docker containers) different identity managers (e.g. different external LDAP, internal IDM) different reverse proxies (e.g. traefik) different OpenIDConnect IDPs (e.g builtin IDP, keycloak, AzureAD) for some functionalities you will need an LDAP server where the IDP and oCIS both get the users from keycloak example service configuration different storage systems (decomposedFS on local POSIX (default), decomposedFS on NFS, S3 ) It\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to test ocis in the same environment where you are planning to use it later (with the LDAP server, storage system, etc. of your organisation).\nrun oCIS For a quick start, please have a look into the getting started documentation of oCIS If you would like to access oCIS remotely please refer to the Basic Remote Setup section.\nadditional tips to allow basic auth (e.g. to easily access oCIS using curl commands) you have to set PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true environment variable if you cannot use real SSL Certificates set OCIS_INSECURE=true as environment variable Testplan user / groups from LDAP Prerequisite:\nconnect ocis to your preferred LDAP server create users and groups in LDAP start ocis with basic auth documentation resources:\nconfigure ocis with LDAP sharing API is compatible to ownCloud 10 webDav operations Test Case Expected Result Comment share file / folder to a group member of the group can access shared item share file / folder to a group, remove member from group in LDAP removed member should not have access to the shared item share file / folder to a group with different permissions, as receiver try to violate the permissions receiver should not be able to violate the permissions try to login with wrong credentials login should not be possible set a quota in LDAP, upload files till the quota is exceeded upload should work till quota is full, uploads should not work when quota is full try to access files / folders of other users access should not be possible try to share with non-existing users and groups sharing should not be possible try to share with user/groups-names that contain special characters sharing should be possible, access shares with that user does not create any problems other sharing should be tried in various ways and in different environments\ndocumentation resources:\nsharing API is compatible to ownCloud 10 webDav operations Test Case Expected Result Comment share a file/folder with the same name from different users receiver can accept and access both file/folders and distinguish them share a file/folder with the same name but different permissions from different users receiver can access both file/folders according to the permissions share a file/folder with the same name but different locations from one user receiver can accept and access both file/folders and distinguish them share a file/folder back to the sharer sharing back should not be possible re-share a file/folder with different permissions sharing with lower permissions is possible, but not with higher decline received share shared resource should not be shown to the receiver parallel deployment configure ocis with LDAP setup oC10 and ocis in parallel create users and groups in LDAP documentation resources:\nsharing API is compatible to ownCloud 10 Test Case Expected Result Comment share file / folder to a group in one implementation (use different permissions), access the items with the other implementation, try to violate the permissions receiver should not be able to violate the permissions share file / folder to a group, remove member from group in LDAP, try to access items with the removed member from both implementations removed member should not have access to the shared item Spaces Prerequisite:\nstart ocis with basic auth variable declaration, for curl examples: SERVER_URI=https://localhost:9200 GRAPH_API_PATH=graph/v1.0 SHARE_API_PATH=ocs/v2.php/apps/files_sharing/api/v1/shares USER=admin PASSWORD=admin create a new user curl -k -u $USER:$PASSWORD \u0026quot;$SERVER_URI/$GRAPH_API_PATH/users\u0026quot;

Setup clamAV With Docker Linux OS user Mac OS user Run oCIS Run the Acceptance Test Running Text Preview Tests Containing Unicode Characters To run tests in the test suite you have two options. You may go the easy way and just run the test suite in docker. But for some tasks you could also need to install the test suite natively, which requires a little more setup since PHP and some dependencies need to be installed.\nBoth ways to run tests with the test suites are described here.\nTesting With Test Suite in Docker Let\u0026rsquo;s see what is available. Invoke the following command from within the root of the oCIS repository.\nmake -C tests/acceptance/docker help Basically we have two sources for feature tests and test suites:\noCIS feature test and test suites tests and test suites transferred from ownCloud core, they have prefix coreApi At the moment, both can be applied to oCIS since the api of oCIS is designed to be compatible with ownCloud.\nAs a storage backend, we offer oCIS native storage, also called ocis. This stores files directly on disk. Along with that we also provide S3 storage driver.\nYou can invoke two types of test suite runs:\nrun a full test suite, which consists of multiple feature tests run a single feature or single scenario in a feature Run Full Test Suite Local oCIS Tests (prefix api) The names of the full test suite make targets have the same naming as in the CI pipeline. See the available local oCIS specific test suites here. They can be run with ocis storage and S3 storage.\nFor example, command:\nmake -C tests/acceptance/docker localApiTests-apiGraph-ocis runs the same tests as the localApiTests-apiGraph-ocis CI pipeline, which runs the oCIS test suite \u0026ldquo;apiGraph\u0026rdquo; against the oCIS server with ocis storage.\nAnd command:\nmake -C tests/acceptance/docker localApiTests-apiGraph-s3ng runs the oCIS test suite apiGraph against the oCIS server with s3 storage.\nWhile running the tests, oCIS server is started with ociswrapper (i.e. WITH_WRAPPER=true) by default. In order to run the tests without ociswrapper, provide WITH_WRAPPER=false when running the tests. For example:\nWITH_WRAPPER=false \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature:26\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-ocis-storage But some test suites that are tagged with @env-config require the oCIS server to be run with ociswrapper. So, running those tests require WITH_WRAPPER=true (default setting).\nTo run the tests that require an email server (tests tagged with @email), you need to provide START_EMAIL=true while running the tests.\nSTART_EMAIL=true \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiNotification/emailNotification.feature\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-ocis-storage To run the tests that require tika service (tests tagged with @tikaServiceNeeded), you need to provide START_TIKA=true while running the tests.\nSTART_TIKA=true \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiSearch/contentSearch.feature\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-ocis-storage To run the tests that require an antivirus service (tests tagged with @antivirus), you need to provide the following environment variables while running the tests.\nSTART_ANTIVIRUS=true \\ OCIS_ASYNC_UPLOADS=true \\ OCIS_ADD_RUN_SERVICES=antivirus \\ POSTPROCESSING_STEPS=virusscan \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiAntivirus/antivirus.feature\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-ocis-storage Tests Transferred From ownCloud Core (prefix coreApi) Command make -C tests/acceptance/docker Core-API-Tests-ocis-storage-3 runs the same tests as the Core-API-Tests-ocis-storage-3 CI pipeline, which runs the third (out of ten) test suite groups transferred from ownCloud core against the oCIS server with ocis storage.\nAnd make -C tests/acceptance/docker Core-API-Tests-s3ng-storage-3 runs the third (out of ten) test suite groups transferred from ownCloud core against the oCIS server with s3 storage.\nRun Single Feature Test The tests for a single feature (a feature file) can also be run against the different storage backends. To do that, multiple make targets with the schema test-\u0026lt;test-source\u0026gt;-feature-\u0026lt;storage-backend\u0026gt; are available. To select a single feature you have to add an additional BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026lt;path-to-feature-file\u0026gt; parameter when invoking the make command.\nFor example;\nBEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-ocis-storage BEHAT_FEATURE must be pointing to a valid feature file And to run a single scenario in a feature, you can do:\nA specific scenario from a feature can be run by adding :\u0026lt;line-number\u0026gt; at the end of the feature file path. For example, to run the scenario at line 26 of the feature file apiGraph/createUser.feature, simply add the line number like this: apiGraph/createUser.feature:26. Note that the line numbers mentioned in the examples might not always point to a scenario, so always check the line numbers before running the test. BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature:26\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-ocis-storage Similarly, with S3 storage;\n# run a whole feature BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-s3ng-storage # run a single scenario BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature:26\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-ocis-feature-s3ng-storage In the same way, tests transferred from ownCloud core can be run as:\n# run a whole feature BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/coreApiAuth/webDavAuth.feature\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-core-feature-ocis-storage # run a single scenario BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/coreApiAuth/webDavAuth.feature:13\u0026#39; \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker test-core-feature-ocis-storage The test suites transferred from ownCloud core have coreApi prefixed oCIS Image to Be Tested (Skip Local Image Build) By default, the tests will be run against the docker image built from your current working state of the oCIS repository. For some purposes it might also be handy to use an oCIS image from Docker Hub. Therefore, you can provide the optional flag OCIS_IMAGE_TAG=... which must contain an available docker tag of the owncloud/ocis registry on Docker Hub (e.g. \u0026rsquo;latest\u0026rsquo;).\nOCIS_IMAGE_TAG=latest \\ make -C tests/acceptance/docker localApiTests-apiGraph-ocis Test Log Output While a test is running or when it is finished, you can attach to the logs generated by the tests.\nmake -C tests/acceptance/docker show-test-logs The log output is opened in less. You can navigate up and down with your cursors. By pressing \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; you can follow the latest line of the output. Cleanup During testing we start a redis and oCIS docker container. These will not be stopped automatically. You can stop them with:\nmake -C tests/acceptance/docker clean Testing With Test Suite Natively Installed We have two sets of tests:\ntest-acceptance-api set was created for oCIS. Mainly for testing spaces features.\ntest-acceptance-from-core-api set was transferred from ownCloud core repository. The suite name of all tests transferred from the ownCloud core repository starts with coreApi\nRun oCIS Create an up-to-date oCIS binary by building oCIS\nTo start oCIS:\nIDM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \\ ocis/bin/ocis init --insecure true OCIS_INSECURE=true PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true \\ ocis/bin/ocis server PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH will allow the acceptance tests to make requests against the provisioning api (and other endpoints) using basic auth.\nRun Local oCIS Tests (prefix api) make test-acceptance-api \\ TEST_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:9200 \\ TEST_WITH_GRAPH_API=true \\ Run Tests Transferred From ownCloud Core (prefix coreApi) make test-acceptance-from-core-api \\ TEST_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:9200 \\ TEST_WITH_GRAPH_API=true \\ Useful environment variables:\nTEST_SERVER_URL: oCIS server url. Please, adjust the server url according to your setup.\nBEHAT_FEATURE: to run a single feature\nA specific scenario from a feature can be run by adding :\u0026lt;line-number\u0026gt; at the end of the feature file path. For example, to run the scenario at line 26 of the feature file apiGraph/createUser.feature, simply add the line number like this: apiGraph/createUser.feature:26. Note that the line numbers mentioned in the examples might not always point to a scenario, so always check the line numbers before running the test. Example:\nBEHAT_FEATURE=tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature\nOr\nBEHAT_FEATURE=tests/acceptance/features/apiGraph/createUser.feature:12\nBEHAT_SUITE: to run a single suite\nExample:\nBEHAT_SUITE=apiGraph\nSTORAGE_DRIVER: to run tests with a different user storage driver. Available options are ocis (default), owncloudsql and s3ng\nExample:\nSTORAGE_DRIVER=owncloudsql\nSTOP_ON_FAILURE: to stop running tests after the first failure\nExample:\nSTOP_ON_FAILURE=true\nUse Existing Tests for BDD As a lot of scenarios from test-acceptance-from-core-api are written for oC10, we can use those tests for Behaviour driven development in oCIS. Every scenario that does not work in oCIS with \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; storage, is listed in tests/acceptance/expected-failures-API-on-OCIS-storage.md with a link to the related issue.\nThose scenarios are run in the ordinary acceptance test pipeline in CI. The scenarios that fail are checked against the expected failures. If there are any differences then the CI pipeline fails.\nThe tests are not currently run in CI with the OWNCLOUD or EOS storage drivers, so there are no expected-failures files for those.\nIf you want to work on a specific issue\nlocally run each of the tests marked with that issue in the expected failures file.\nE.g.:\nmake test-acceptance-from-core-api \\ TEST_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:9200 \\ TEST_WITH_GRAPH_API=true \\ STORAGE_DRIVER=OCIS \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/coreApiVersions/fileVersions.feature:147\u0026#39; the tests will fail, try to understand how and why they are failing\nfix the code\ngo back to 1. and repeat till the tests are passing.\nremove those tests from the expected failures file\nmake a PR that has the fixed code, and the relevant lines removed from the expected failures file.\nRunning ENV Config Tests (@env-Config) Test suites tagged with @env-config are used to test the environment variables that are used to configure oCIS. These tests are special tests that require the oCIS server to be run using ociswrapper.\nRun oCIS With ociswrapper # working dir: ocis repo root dir # init oCIS IDM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \\ ocis/bin/ocis init --insecure true # build the wrapper cd tests/ociswrapper make build # run oCIS PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true \\ ./bin/ociswrapper serve --bin=../../ocis/bin/ocis Run the Tests OCIS_WRAPPER_URL=http://localhost:5200 \\ TEST_WITH_GRAPH_API=true \\ TEST_SERVER_URL=\u0026#34;https://localhost:9200\u0026#34; \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=tests/acceptance/features/apiAsyncUpload/delayPostprocessing.feature \\ make test-acceptance-api Writing New ENV Config Tests While writing tests for a new oCIS ENV configuration, please make sure to follow these guidelines:\nTag the test suite (or test scenarios) with @env-config Use OcisConfigHelper.php for helper functions - provides functions to reconfigure the running oCIS instance. Recommended: add the new step implementations in OcisConfigContext.php Running Test Suite With Email Service (@email) Test suites that are tagged with @email require an email service.

Feel free to add links to ADRs, PRs and Issues in short warning boxes like this. Storage Spaces A storage space is a logical concept. It organizes a set of resources in a hierarchical tree. It has a single owner (user or group), a quota, permissions and is identified by a storage space id.\nExamples would be every user\u0026rsquo;s personal storage space, project storage spaces or group storage spaces. While they all serve different purposes and may or may not have workflows like antivirus scanning enabled, we need a way to identify and manage these subtrees in a generic way. By creating a dedicated concept for them this becomes easier and literally makes the codebase cleaner. A storage Spaces Registry then allows listing the capabilities of storage spaces, e.g. free space, quota, owner, syncable, root etag, upload workflow steps, \u0026hellip;\nFinally, a logical storage space id is not tied to a specific spaces provider. If the storage driver supports it, we can import existing files including their file id, which makes it possible to move storage spaces between spaces providers to implement storage classes, e.g. with or without archival, workflows, on SSDs or HDDs.\nShares To be clarified: we are aware that storage spaces may be too \u0026lsquo;heavyweight\u0026rsquo; for ad hoc sharing with groups. That being said, there is no technical reason why group shares should not be treated like storage spaces that users can provision themselves. They would share the quota with the users home or personal storage space and the share initiator would be the sole owner. Technically, the mechanism of treating a share like a new storage space would be the same. This obviously also extends to user shares and even file individual shares that would be wrapped in a virtual collection. It would also become possible to share collections of arbitrary files in a single storage space, e.g. the ten best pictures from a large album.\nNotes We can implement ListStorageSpaces by either\niterating over the root of the storage and treating every folder following the \u0026lt;user_layout\u0026gt; as a home storage space, iterating over the root of the storage and treating every folder following a new \u0026lt;project_layout\u0026gt; as a project storage space, or iterating over the root of the storage and treating every folder following a generic \u0026lt;layout\u0026gt; as a storage space for a configurable space type, or we allow configuring a map of space type to layout (based on the CreateStorageSpaceRequest) which would allow things like home=/var/lib/ocis/storage/home/{{substr 0 1 .Owner.Username}}/{{.Owner.Username}} spaces=/spaces/var/lib/ocis/storage/projects/{{.Name}} ","description":"Editing a Storage Space Updating a space property Updating a space description Quotas Quota Enforcement Considerations Storage Spaces Shares Notes Editing a Storage Space The OData specification allows for a mirage of ways of addressing an entity.

Since oCIS is different in its architecture compared to ownCloud 10, we had to come up with a similar (yet slightly different) solution. To extend the functionality of oCIS, you can write or install extensions. An extension is basically any running code which integrates into oCIS and provides functionality to oCIS and its users. Because extensions are just microservices providing an API, you can technically choose any programming language you like - a huge improvement to ownCloud 10, where it was nearly impossible to use a different programming language than PHP.\nWe will now introduce you to the oCIS extension system and show you how you can create a custom extension yourself.\nExtension examples Technically every service in oCIS is an extension, even if oCIS would not really work without some of them. Therefore, you can draw inspiration from any of the plenty of extensions in the oCIS monorepo.\nBesides these \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; extensions in the oCIS monorepo, there are two more extensions you should be aware of:\nHello WOPI server Differences between the extensions maintained inside the oCIS monorepo and the ones maintained in their own repository are:\nextensions inside the oCIS monorepo are all written in Go, whereas other extensions may choose the programming language freely extensions inside the oCIS monorepo heavily share tooling to reduce maintenance efforts, whereas other extensions may use different tooling (e.g. a different CI system) extensions inside the oCIS monorepo will be all build into one binary and started with the ocis server command. All other extensions must be started individually besides oCIS. For quickstart purposes we also offer a template project which can be used to generate all the boilerplate code for you. But you also can decide to use your own project layout or even a different programming language.\nIntegration into oCIS Depending on the functionality of your extension, you might need to integrate with one or multiple of the components of oCIS mentioned below.\nownCloud Web If your extension is not just doing something in the background, you will need a UI in order to allow the user to interact with your extension. You could just provide your own web frontend for that purpose, but for a better user experience you can easily integrate into the web frontend of oCIS, the new ownCloud Web.\nownCloud Web allows you to write an extension for itself and therefore offers a seamless user experience. Upon login, the user will be able to use the application switcher to switch between the files view, settings and other available and installed extensions, yours included. Furthermore it is also possible to register your extension for different file actions. As an example, you could offer your extension to the user for creating and editing office documents. The user will then be able to create or open a file with your application directly from the files view. How to provide create an extension for ownCloud Web can be seen best in the Hello extension, whereas plain file handling without any web frontend is available in the WOPI server extension.\nTo make ownCloud Web pick up your extension, you need to activate it in the configuration like seen in the Hello extension.\nFor a consistent look and feel, ownCloud Web uses an external design library, the ownCloud design system. Since its classes and components are available through the wrapping web runtime, we highly recommend you to leverage it in your extension as well.\nSettings An extension likely has some behaviour which the user can configure. Fundamental configuration will often be done by administrators during deployment, via configuration files or by setting environment variables. But for other settings, which are supposed to change more often or which are even user specific, this is not a viable way. Therefore you need to offer the users a UI where they can configure your extension to their liking. Because implementing something like this is a repetitive task among extensions, oCIS already offers the settings extensions which does that for your extension. Your extension just needs to register settings bundles, respective permissions and finally read the current values from the settings service. You can read more on that on the settings extension and see how oCIS Hello uses these settings.\nProxy The Proxy is an API gateway and acts as the single connection point where all external request from users and devices need to pass through.\nTo make sure that requests can reach your extension\u0026rsquo;s API, you need to register one or multiple endpoints at the proxy. The registration is an easy task and can be seen best on the oCIS Hello example.\nAs files in ownCloud must always stay private (unless you share them with your friends or coworkers), requests to oCIS have an authenticated user context. This user context is also available to your extension and can be used to interact with the user\u0026rsquo;s files. How to get the user context and authentication can be seen on the oCIS Hello example.\nStorage oCIS leverages the CS3 APIs and CS3 REVA as a storage system because it offers a very flexible setup and supports a variety of storage backends like EOS, S3 and of course your local hard drive. REVA makes it easy to support more storage backends as needed.\nIf you need to interact with files directly, you have the full power of the CS3 APIs in your hand. With the user context and the user\u0026rsquo;s authentication token, which your extensions gets from the proxy, your extension can make these request in behalf of the user.\nIf your extension needs to store persistent data which is not supposed to live in the user\u0026rsquo;s home folder, there is also a so-called metadata storage, intended for exactly that purpose. You should always use the metadata storage in favor of the local filesystem for persistent files, because your extension will then automatically use the storage backend the oCIS admin decides to use. For a temporary cache it is perfectly fine to use the local filesystem.\n","description":"oCIS is all about files, sync and share - but most of the time there is more you want to do with your files, e.g. having a different view on your photo collection or editing your offices files in an online file editor. ownCloud 10 faced the same problem and solved it with applications, which can extend the functionality of ownCloud 10 in a wide range.

First all users need to migrate to the new architecture, then the global namespace needs to be introduced. Finally, the data on disk can be migrated user by user by switching the storage driver.\n@jfd: It might be easier to introduce the spaces api in oc10 and then migrate to oCIS. We cannot migrate both at the same time, the architecture to oCIS (which will change fileids) and introduce a global namespace (which requires stable fileids to let clients handle moves without redownloading). Either we implement arbitrary mounting of shares in oCIS / reva or we make clients and oc10 spaces aware. Migration Stages Stage 0: pre migration Is the pre-migration stage when having a functional ownCloud 10 instance.\nFAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage 1: introduce ownCloud Web Install and introduce ownCloud Web and let users test it voluntarily to gain early feedback on the new UI.\nSteps Deploy web and enable switching to and from it. For more details see: ownCloud 10 with ownCloud Web\nTODO allow limiting the web ui switch to an \u0026rsquo;early adopters\u0026rsquo; group\nValidation Ensure switching back and forth between the classic ownCloud 10 web UI and ownCloud web works as at our https://demo.owncloud.com.\nRollback Should there be problems with ownCloud web at this point it can simply be removed from the menu and be undeployed.\nNotes The ownCloud 10 demo instance uses OAuth to obtain a token for ownCloud web and currently always requires explicit consent. In oCIS the token is provided by the OpenID Connect Identity Provider, which may skip the consent step for trusted clients for a more seamless login experience. You may want to introduce OpenID Connect before enabling the new web UI. TODO make oauth2 in oc10 trust the new web ui, based on redirect_uri and CSRF so no explicit consent is needed?\nFAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage 2: introduce OpenID Connect Basic auth requires us to properly store and manage user credentials. Something we would rather like to delegate to a tool specifically built for that task. While SAML and Shibboleth are protocols that solve that problem, they are limited to web clients. Desktop and mobile clients were an afterthought and keep running into timeouts. For these reasons, we decided to move to OpenID Connect as our primary authentication protocol.\nTODO @butonic add ADR for OpenID Connect and flesh out pros and cons of the above\nUser impact When introducing OpenID Connect, the clients will detect the new authentication scheme when their current way of authenticating returns an error. Users will then have to reauthorize at the OpenID Connect IdP, which again, may be configured to skip the consent step for trusted clients.\nSteps There are multiple products that can be used as an OpenID Connect IdP. We test with LibreGraph Connect, which is also embedded in oCIS. Other alternatives include Keycloak or Ping. Please refer to the corresponding setup instructions for the product you intend to use. TODO @butonic flesh out oCIS IDP documentation\nAdd Openid Connect (OIDC) support to ownCloud 10. Validation When OpenID Connect support is enabled verify that all clients can login:\nweb classic ownCloud web desktop android iOS Rollback Should there be problems with OpenID Connect at this point you can disable the app. Users will have to reauthenticate in this case.\nNotes Legacy clients relying on Basic auth or app passwords need to be migrated to OpenId Connect to work with oCIS. For a transition period Basic auth in oCIS can be enabled with `PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH=true`, but we strongly recommend adopting OpenID Connect for other tools as well. While OpenID Connect providers will send an iss and sub claim that relying parties (services like oCIS or ownCloud 10) can use to identify users we recommend introducing a dedicated, globally unique, persistent, non-reassignable user identifier like a UUID for every user. This ownclouduuid should be sent as an additional claim to save additional lookups on the server side. It will become the user id in oCIS, e.g. when searching for recipients the ownclouduuid will be used to persist permissions with the share manager. It has a different purpose than the ownCloud 10 username, which is used to login. Using UUIDs we can not only mitigate username collisions when merging multiple instances but also allow renaming usernames after the migration to oCIS has been completed.\nFAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage 3: introduce oCIS internally Before letting oCIS handle end user requests we will first make it available in the internal network. By subsequently adding services we can add functionality and verify the services work as intended.\nStart oCIS backend and make read only tests on existing data using the owncloudsql storage driver which will read (and write)\nblobs from the same datadirectory layout as in ownCloud 10 metadata from the ownCloud 10 database: The oCIS share manager will read share information from the ownCloud database using an owncloud driver as well. TODO @butonic add guide on how to configure owncloudsql\nTODO we need a share manager that can read from the ownCloud 10 database as well as from whatever new backend will be used for a pure oCIS setup. Currently, that would be the json file. Or that is migrated after all users have switched to oCIS. \u0026ndash; jfd\nUser impact None, only administrators will be able to explore oCIS during this stage.\nSteps and verifications We are going to run and explore a series of services that will together handle the same requests as ownCloud 10. For initial exploration the oCIS binary is recommended. The services can later be deployed using a single oCIS runtime or in multiple containers.\nStorage provider for file metadata Deploy OCIS storage provider with owncloudsql driver. Set read_only: true in the storage provider config. TODO @butonic add read only flag to storage drivers Use cli tool to list files using the CS3 api File ID alternatives Multiple ownCloud instances can be merged into one oCIS instance. To prevent the numeric ids from colliding, the file ids will be prefixed with a new storage space id which is used by oCIS to route requests to the correct storage provider. See Stage 8 below.\nAlternative 1 Add a routable prefix to fileids in oc10, and replicate the prefix in oCIS.\nStage-3.1 Let oc10 render file ids with prefixes: \u0026lt;instance name\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;numeric storageid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt;. This will allow clients to handle moved files.\nStage-3.2 Roll out new clients that understand the spaces API and know how to convert local sync pairs for legacy oc10 /webdav or /dav/files/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; home folders into multiple sync pairs. One pair for /webdav/home or /dav/files/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/home and another pair for every accepted share. The shares will be accessible at /webdav/shares/ when the server side enables the spaces API. Files can be identified using \u0026lt;instance name\u0026gt;$\u0026lt;numeric storageid\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt; and moved to the correct sync pair.\nStage-3.3 Enable spaces API in oc10:\nNew clients will get a response from the spaces API and can set up new sync pairs. Legacy clients will still poll /webdav or /dav/files/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; where they will see new subfolders instead of the users home. They will move down the users files into /home and shares into /shares. Custom sync pairs will no longer be available, causing the legacy client to leave local files in place. They can be picked up manually when installing a new client. Alternative 2 An additional uuid property used only to detect moves. A lookup by uuid is not necessary for this. The /dav/meta endpoint would still take the fileid. Clients would use the uuid to detect moves and set up new sync pairs when migrating to a global namespace.\nStage-3.1 Generate a uuid for every file as a file property. Clients can submit a uuid when creating files. The server will create a uuid if the client did not provide one.\nStage-3.2 Roll out new clients that understand the spaces API and know how to convert local sync pairs for legacy oc10 /webdav or /dav/files/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt; home folders into multiple sync pairs. One pair for /webdav/home or /dav/files/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/home and another pair for every accepted share. The shares will be accessible at /webdav/shares/ when the server side enables the spaces API. Files can be identified using the uuid and moved to the correct sync pair.\nStage-4.1 When reading the files from oCIS return the same uuid. It can be migrated to an extended attribute or it can be read from oc10. If users change it the client will not be able to detect a move and maybe other weird stuff happens. What if the uuid gets lost on the server side due to a partial restore?\ngraph API endpoint Deploy graph api to list spaces Use curl to list spaces using graph drives endpoint owncloud flavoured WebDAV endpoint Deploy ocdav Use curl to send PROPFIND data provider for up and download Deploy dataprovider Use curl to up and download files Use tus to upload files Deploy \u0026hellip;\nshare manager Deploy share manager with ownCloud driver\nreva gateway Deploy gateway to authenticate requests?

The file ids will be prefixed with a new storage space id which is used to route requests to the correct storage provider. FAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage 4: internal write access with oCIS Test writing data with oCIS into the existing ownCloud 10 data directory using the owncloudsql storage driver.\nUser impact Only administrators will be able to explore oCIS during this stage. End users should not be affected if the testing is limited to test users.\nSteps Set read_only: false in the storage provider config.\nTODO @butonic add read only flag to storage drivers\nVerification Rollback Set read_only: true in the storage provider config.\nTODO @butonic add read only flag to storage drivers\nNotes With write access it becomes possible to manipulate existing files and shares. FAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage-5: introduce user aware proxy In the previous stages oCIS was only accessible for administrators with access to the network. To expose only a single service to the internet, oCIS comes with a user aware proxy that can be used to route requests to the existing ownCloud 10 installation or oCIS, based on the authenticated user. The proxy uses OIDC to identify the logged-in user and route them to the configured backend.\nUser impact The IP address of the ownCloud host changes. There is no change for the file sync and share functionality when requests are handled by the oCIS codebase as it uses the same database and storage system as owncloud 10.\nSteps and verifications Deploy oCIS proxy Deploy the ocis proxy Verify the requests are routed based on the ownCloud 10 routing policy oc10 by default Test user based routing Change the routing policy for a user or an early adopters group to ocis TODO @butonic currently, the migration selector will use the ocis policy for users that have been added to the accounts service. IMO we need to evaluate a claim from the IdP. Verify the requests are routed based on the oCIS routing policy oc10 for \u0026lsquo;migrated\u0026rsquo; users. At this point you are ready to rock \u0026amp; roll!\nLet ownCloud domain point to proxy Update the dns to use the oCIS proxy instead of the ownCloud application servers directly. Let DNS propagate the change and monitor requests moving from the ownCloud application servers to the oCIS proxy. Verify the DNS change has propagated sufficiently. All requests should now use the oCIS Proxy. Rollback Should there be a problem with the oCIS routes the user can be routed to ownCloud by changing his routing policy. In case of unfixable problems with the proxy the DNS needs to be updated to use the ownCloud 10 application servers directly. This could also be done in a load balancer.\nNotes The proxy is stateless, multiple instances can be deployed as needed. FAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage-6: parallel deployment Running ownCloud 10 and oCIS in parallel is a crucial stage for the migration: it allows users access to group shares regardless of the system that is being used to access the data. A user by user migration with multiple domains would technically break group shares when users vanish because they (and their data) are no longer available in the old system.\nDepending on the amount of power users on an instance, the admin may want to allow users to voluntarily migrate to the oCIS backend. A monitoring system can be used to visualize the behavior for the two systems and gain trust in the overall stability and performance.\nUser impact Since the underling data is still stored in the same systems, a similar or performance can be expected.\nSee TODO hmpf outdated didn\u0026rsquo;t we want to run them nightly? \u0026hellip; TODO @butonic update performance comparisons nightly\nSteps There are several options to move users to the oCIS backend:\nUse a canary app to let users decide themselves Use an early adopters group with an opt-in Force migrate users in batch or one by one at the administrators will Verification The same verification steps as for the internal testing stage apply. Just from the outside.\nRollback Until now, the oCIS configuration mimics ownCloud 10 and uses the old data directory layout and the ownCloud 10 database. Users can seamlessly be switched from ownCloud 10 to oCIS and back again.\nTODO @butonic we need a canary app that allows users to decide for themselves which backend to use\nNotes Running the two systems in parallel stage Try to keep the duration of this stage short. Until now we only added services and made the system more complex. oCIS aims to reduce the maintenance cost of an ownCloud instance. You will not get there if you keep both systems alive.\nFAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage-7: introduce spaces using ocis To encourage users to switch you can promote the workspaces feature that is built into oCIS. The ownCloud 10 storage backend can be used for existing users. New users and group or project spaces can be provided by storage providers that better suit the underlying storage system.\nSteps First, the admin needs to\ndeploy a storage provider with the storage driver that best fits the underlying storage system and requirements. register the storage in the storage registry with a new storage id (we recommend a uuid). Then a user with the necessary create storage space role can create a storage space and assign Managers.\nTODO @butonic a user with management permission needs to be presented with a list of storage spaces where he can see the amount of free space and decide on which storage provider the storage space should be created. For now a config option for the default storage provider for a specific type might be good enough.\nVerification The new storage space should show up in the /graph/drives endpoint for the managers and the creator of the space.\nNotes Depending on the requirements and acceptable tradeoffs, a database less deployment using the ocis or s3ng storage driver is possible. There is also a cephfs driver on the way, that directly works on the API level instead of POSIX.\nStage-8: shut down ownCloud 10 Disable ownCloud 10 in the proxy, all requests are now handled by oCIS, shut down oc10 web servers and redis (or keep for calendar \u0026amp; contacts only? rip out files from oCIS?)\nUser impact All users are already sent to the oCIS backend. Shutting down ownCloud 10 will remove the old web UI, apps and functionality that is not yet present in ownCloud web. For example contacts and calendar.\nTODO @butonic recommend alternatives\nSteps Shut down the apache servers that are running the ownCloud 10 PHP code. DO NOT SHUT DOWN THE DATABASE, YET! Verification The ownCloud 10 classic web UI should no longer be reachable.\nRollback Redeploy ownCloud 10.\nNotes The database needs to remain online until the storage layer and share metadata have been migrated as well. One thing at a time. FAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage 9: storage migration To get rid of the database we will move the metadata from the old ownCloud 10 database into dedicated storage providers. This can happen in a user by user fashion. group drives can properly be migrated to group, project or workspaces in this stage.\nUser impact Noticeable performance improvements because we effectively shard the storage logic and persistence layer.\nSteps User by user storage migration from owncloud or ownclouds3 driver to ocis/s3ng/cephfs\u0026hellip; currently this means copying the metadata from one storage provider to another using the cs3 api. Change the responsible storage provider for a storage space (e.g. a user home, a group or project space are a workspace) in the storage registry. TODO @butonic implement ownclouds3 based on s3ng TODO @butonic implement tiered storage provider for seamless migration TODO @butonic document how to manually do that until the storage registry can discover that on its own.\nVerification Start with a test user, then move to early adopters and finally migrate all users.\nRollback To switch the storage provider again the same storage space migration can be performed again: copy metadata and blob data using the CS3 api, then change the responsible storage provider in the storage registry.\nNotes Multiple ownCloud instances can be merged into one oCIS instance. The file ids will be prefixed with a new storage space id which is used to route requests to the correct storage provider. The storage space migration will become a seamless feature in the future that allows administrators to move users to storage systems with different capabilities, to implement premium features, deprovisioning strategies or archiving.\nFAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nStage-10: share metadata migration Migrate share data to yet to determine share manager backend and shut down ownCloud database.\nThe ownCloud 10 database still holds share information in the oc_share and oc_share_external tables. They are used to efficiently answer queries about who shared what with whom. In oCIS shares are persisted using a share manager and if desired these grants are also sent to the storage provider so it can set ACLs if possible. Only one system should be responsible for the shares, which in case of treating the storage as the primary source effectively turns the share manager into a cache.\nUser impact Depending on chosen the share manager provider some sharing requests should be faster: listing incoming and outgoing shares is no longer bound to the ownCloud 10 database but to whatever technology is used by the share provider:\nFor non HA scenarios they can be served from memory, backed by a simple json file. TODO: implement share manager with redis / nats / \u0026hellip; key value store backend: use the micro store interface please \u0026hellip; Steps Start new share manager Migrate metadata using the CS3 API (copy from old to new) Shut down old share manager Shut down ownCloud 10 database TODO for HA implement share manager with redis / nats / \u0026hellip; key value store backend: use the micro store interface please \u0026hellip; TODO for batch migration implement share data migration cli with progress that reads all shares via the cs3 api from one provider and writes them into another provider TODO for seamless migration implement tiered/chained share provider that reads share data from the old provider and writes new shares to the new one TODO for storage provider as source of truth persist ALL share data in the storage provider. Currently, part is stored in the share manager, part is in the storage provider. We can keep both, but the share manager should directly persist its metadata to the storage system used by the storage provider so metadata is kept in sync\nVerification After copying all metadata start a dedicated gateway and change the configuration to use the new share manager. Route a test user, a test group and early adopters to the new gateway. When no problems occur you can start the desired number of share managers and roll out the change to all gateways.\nTODO let the gateway write updates to multiple share managers \u0026hellip; or rely on the tiered/chained share manager provider to persist to both providers\nRollback To switch the share manager to the database one revert routing users to the new share manager. If you already shut down the old share manager start it again. Use the tiered/chained share manager provider in reverse configuration (new share provider as read only, old as write) and migrate the shares again. You can also restore a database backup if needed.\nStage-11 Profit! Well, on the one hand you do not need to maintain a clustered database setup and can rely on the storage system. On the other hand you are now in microservice wonderland and will have to relearn how to identify bottlenecks and scale oCIS accordingly. The good thing is that tools like jaeger and prometheus have evolved and will help you understand what is going on. But this is a different topic. See you on the other side!\nFAQ Feel free to add your question as a PR to this document using the link at the top of this page!\nArchitectural differences The fundamental difference between ownCloud 10 and oCIS is that the file metadata is moved from the database in the oc_filecache table (which is misnamed, as it actually is an index) to the storage provider who can place metadata as close to the underlying storage system as possible. In effect, the file metadata is sharded over multiple specialized services.\nData that will be migrated Currently, oCIS focuses on file sync and share use cases.\nBlob data In ownCloud 10 the files are laid out on disk in the data directory using the following layout:\ndata ├── einstein │ ├── cache │ ├── files │ │ ├── Photos │ │ │ └── Portugal.jpg │ │ ├── Projects │ │ │ └── Notes.md │ │ └── ownCloud Manual.pdf │ ├── files_external │ ├── files_trashbin │ │ ├── files │ │ │ ├── Documents.d1564687985 │ │ │ ├── TODO.txt.d1565721976 │ │ │ └── welcome.txt.d1564775872 │ │ └── versions │ │ │ ├── TODO.txt.v1564605543.d1565721976 │ │ │ └── TODO.txt.v1564775936.d1565721976 │ ├── files_versions │ │ ├── Projects │ │ │ ├── Notes.md.v1496912691 │ │ │ └── Notes.md.v1540305560 │ │ └── ownCloud Manual.pdf.v1396628249 │ ├── thumbnails │ │ └── 123 │ │ │ ├── 2048-1536-max.png │ │ │ └── 32-32.png // the file id, e.g. of /Photos/Portugal.jpg │ └── uploads ├── marie │ ├── cache │ ├── files │ ├── files_external │ ├── files_trashbin │ ├── files_versions │ └── thumbnails │ … ├── moss … The data directory may also contain subfolders for ownCloud 10 applications like avatars, gallery, files_external and cache.\nWhen an object storage is used as the primary storage all file blobs are stored by their file id and a prefix, e.g.: urn:oid:\u0026lt;fileid\u0026gt;.\nThe three types of blobs we need to migrate are stored in\nfiles for file blobs, the current file content, files_trashbin for trashed files (and their versions) and files_versions for file blobs of older versions. Filecache table In both cases the file metadata, including a full replication of the file tree, is stored in the oc_filecache table of an ownCloud 10 database. The primary key of a row is the file id. It is used to attach additional metadata like shares, tags, favorites or arbitrary file properties.\nThe filecache table itself has more metadata:\nField Type Null Key Default Extra Comment Migration fileid bigint(20) NO PRI NULL auto_increment MUST become the oCIS opaqueid of a file reference. ocis driver stores it in extended attributes and can use numbers as node ids on disk. for eos see note below table storage int(11) NO MUL 0 the filecache holds metadata for multiple storages corresponds to an oCIS storage space path varchar(4000) YES NULL the path relative to the storages root MUST become the path relative to the storage root. files prefix needs to be trimmed. path_hash varchar(32) NO *mysql once had problems indexing long paths, so we stored a hash for lookup by path. - parent bigint(20) NO MUL 0 used to implement the hierarchy and listing children of a folder by id. redundant with path - name varchar(250) YES NULL basename of path - mimetype int(11) NO 0 joined with the oc_mimetypes table. only relevant for object storage deployments can be determined from blob / file extension mimepart int(11) NO 0 \u0026quot; can be determined from blob / file extension size bigint(20) NO 0 same as blob size unless encryption is used MAY become size, can be determined from blob mtime bigint(20) NO 0 same as blob mtime for files MAY become mtime (can be determined from blob as well), for directories MUST become tmtime encrypted int(11) NO 0 encrypted flag oCIS currently does not support encryption etag varchar(40) YES NULL used to propagate changes in a tree MUST be migrated (or calculated in the same way) to prevent clients from syncing unnecessarily unencrypted_size bigint(20) NO 0 same as blob size oCIS currently does not support encryption storage_mtime bigint(20) NO 0 used to detect external storage changes oCIS delegates that to the storage providers and drivers permissions int(11) YES 0 *used as the basis for permissions. synced from disk when running a file scan. * oCIS delegates that to the storage providers and drivers checksum varchar(255) YES NULL same as blob checksum SHOULD become the checksum in the storage provider. eos calculates it itself, ocis driver stores it in extended attributes Note: for EOS a hot migration only works seamlessly if file ids in oc10 are already read from eos.

Unfortunately, this hides the actual source of the error. We could set a breakpoint in line 94 and reproduce the problem, which can be a lot harder than just clicking the share button or sending a curl request again.

What else is there?\nThe first line tells us that looking up the responsible storage provider seems to have succeeded: uri=/cs3.storage.registry.v1beta1.RegistryAPI/GetStorageProvider.\nAt this point it your familiarity with the codebase starts to become a factor.

It also exposes endpoints for registering and manipulating so called settings bundles.\nThe settings defined through settings bundles can be changed by authenticated users in ownCloud Web, if they have enough permissions to edit them. As a result, your service only has to register a settings bundle and permissions for it and oCIS settings takes care of everything else. Your service can simply use the settings values that were set by users.\nIn this chapter we want to show you how to register a settings bundle, the settings permissions and how to use the respective values that were set by users. We do this by customizing the greeter phrase from our greeter service in the Hello extension.\nYou can find the source code, especially how it\u0026rsquo;s integrated into the service, in the following files:\npkg/service/v0/service.go for the requests pkg/command/server.go for the integration of registerSettingsBundles into the service start Register a settings bundle and set the permissions In order to register a settings bundle, you need to create a request message and then send it to the BundleService of oCIS settings through a gRPC call. The same applies for setting permissions on the setting bundles.\nCreate a bundle request request := \u0026amp;settings.SaveBundleRequest{ Bundle: \u0026amp;settings.Bundle{ Id: bundleIDGreeting, Name: \u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;, DisplayName: \u0026#34;Greeting\u0026#34;, Extension: \u0026#34;ocis-hello\u0026#34;, Type: settings.Bundle_TYPE_DEFAULT, Resource: \u0026amp;settings.Resource{ Type: settings.Resource_TYPE_SYSTEM, }, Settings: []*settings.Setting{ { Id: settingIDGreeterPhrase, Name: \u0026#34;phrase\u0026#34;, DisplayName: \u0026#34;Phrase\u0026#34;, Description: \u0026#34;Phrase for replies on the greet request\u0026#34;, Resource: \u0026amp;settings.Resource{ Type: settings.Resource_TYPE_SYSTEM, }, Value: \u0026amp;settings.Setting_StringValue{ StringValue: \u0026amp;settings.String{ Required: true, Default: \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, MaxLength: 15, }, }, }, }, }, The request holds only one field, which is a SettingsBundle. It consists of an Identifier, a DisplayName and a list of Settings.\nThe Extension and the ID of the bundle are required and have to be alphanumeric (- and _ are allowed as well). The ID has to stay stable - if you change it, existing settings will not be migrated to the new identifier. The DisplayName is required and may contain any UTF8 character. It will be shown in the settings user frontend in a generated form, so please try to be descriptive. You can change the DisplayName at any time. Settings is the list of settings you want to make available with this settings bundle. In this example, there is only one setting defined - a string setting for the phrase our greeter uses in the response. You can explore more types of settings in the settings package. All of them come with their own characteristics and validations. For the phrase setting we decided to set it to Required, so that it can\u0026rsquo;t be empty, and to set a MaxLength of 15 characters, so that the phrase is not too long. The ID of the setting is again particularly important, as this is used for referencing the setting in other requests. It has to fulfill the same rules as the other ID attributes. Please also take the time to set a Description, in order to provide accessibility in the generated forms as good as possible. Send bundle request to oCIS settings This request message can be sent to the BundleService of oCIS settings like this:\nsettings := settings.NewBundleService(\u0026#34;com.owncloud.api.settings\u0026#34;, mclient.DefaultClient) response, err := bundleService.SaveBundle(context.Background(), request) We run this request on every start of the Hello extension so that the settings service always has the most recent version of the settings bundle.\nCreate a permission settings request In order to grant admins access to the setting we need to create a AddSettingToBundleRequest.\npermissionRequests := []*settings.AddSettingToBundleRequest{ { BundleId: ssvc.BundleUUIDRoleAdmin, Setting: \u0026amp;settings.Setting{ Id: \u0026#34;d5f42c4b-e1b6-4b59-8eca-fc4b9e9f2320\u0026#34;, Resource: \u0026amp;settings.Resource{ Type: settings.Resource_TYPE_SETTING, Id: settingIDGreeterPhrase, }, Name: \u0026#34;phrase-admin-read\u0026#34;, Value: \u0026amp;settings.Setting_PermissionValue{ PermissionValue: \u0026amp;settings.Permission{ Operation: settings.Permission_OPERATION_READWRITE, Constraint: settings.Permission_CONSTRAINT_OWN, }, }, }, }, } Send permission settings request The AddSettingToBundleRequest then needs to be send to the settings service:\nresponse, err := bundleService.AddSettingToBundle(context.Background(), permissionRequests[i]) Use settings value We registered the greeter phrase setting for a reason: We want to allow authenticated administrator users to customize how users are greeted by the Hello extension. In order to do this, we need to ask oCIS settings on every request, what the greeter phrase of the authenticated user is.\nAccount UUID The settings request has one important prerequisite: As our service is stateless, we need to know the account UUID of the authenticated user the incoming POST request to our greeter service is coming from. As that POST request is coming through oCIS proxy, there is an HTTP header x-access-token that holds a JWT with the account UUID in it. We just have to dismantle the JWT to get the UUID. There is a middleware for that in ocis-pkg. You can look up the server configuration for that middleware in pkg/server/http/server.go. In essence, it dismantles the x-access-token, extracts the account UUID and makes it available in the context.\nIt can be subsequently retrieved from the context like this:\naccountID, ok := metadata.Get(ctx, middleware.AccountID) Create request With the account UUID we can build an Identifier for the request to oCIS settings as follows:\nrq := settings.GetValueByUniqueIdentifiersRequest{ AccountUuid: accountID, SettingId: settingIDGreeterPhrase, } response, err := s.vsClient.GetValueByUniqueIdentifiers(context.Background(), \u0026amp;rq) In order to get the setting we need to know which user (AccountUuid) is requesting the settings value and which setting he is requesting (SettingId).\nSend request This request message can be sent to the settings extension like this:\nvalueService := settings.NewValueService(\u0026#34;com.owncloud.api.settings\u0026#34;, mclient.DefaultClient) response, err := valueService.GetSettingsValue(ctx, request) The request gives us the default or customized greeting phrase, depending on wether it has already been changed by an administrator.\nConclusion You have learned how to register settings bundles, how to get the account UUID of the authenticated user and how to query the settings service for settings values.\n","description":"oCIS provides an settings extension that other extensions can use to make settings accessible to users.\nIn case of the Hello extension administrator users are able to change the greeter message.\nSettings are stored and presented to the user by the oCIS settings extension.

This is being achieved by providing a json file that contains text snippets (like brand name and slogan), paths to images (e.g. logos or favicon) and design tokens for various color, sizing and spacing parameters.\nThis page documents the setup and configuration options, and provides a template for you to get started.\nWays of providing a theme Generally, your theming configuration lives inside a .json file, e.g. theme.json. To load this file, it needs to be correctly referenced inside your config/config.json (example configurations can be found on GitHub).\nTo reference your theme, you have two options:\nUsing a URL, e.g. \u0026quot;theme\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://externalurl.example.com/theme-name/theme.json\u0026quot;,. To avoid CORS issues, please make sure that you host the URL on the same URL as your ownCloud web hosting. For development and testing purposes, you can store your theme.json inside packages/web-runtime/themes/{theme-name}/ and reference it in the config.json. However, this isn\u0026rsquo;t recommended for production use since your changes may get lost when updating oCIS or the web app in OC10. Hint: If no theme is provided, the loading of your custom theme fails or the theme can\u0026rsquo;t be parsed correctly, the standard ownCloud theme will be loaded as a fallback and an error with further information will be logged on the browser console.\nConfiguring a theme Inside your theme.json, there is a common key, which is explained in the next section, and a clients key: Here, you can find the available ownCloud clients - please note that the documentation below focuses on web and check the respective documentation for other clients for details on their themability.\nThe general top-level structure of a valid theme.json is outlined below:\n{ \u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;clients\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;android\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;desktop\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;ios\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;web\u0026#34;: {} } } Common section The common section provides a set of information that is designed to be available for all clients. It gets merged \u0026ldquo;down\u0026rdquo; to the final themes and aims to reduce duplication, but can be overwritten by more specific information inside both the clients\u0026rsquo; defaults and actual themes.\nThe structure of a valid common section is outlined below:\n\u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ownCloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;slogan\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ownCloud – A safe home for all your data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;logo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/logo.svg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;urls\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessDeniedHelp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;imprint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;privacy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } All of the below parameters are required:\nname specifies the publicly visible name slogan specifies the publicly visible slogan logo specifies the logo in e.g. the top bar within the web UI accessDeniedHelp specifies the target URL for the access denied help link imprintUrl specifies the target URL for the imprint link privacyUrl specifies the target URL for the privacy link Web Theme The structure of a valid web client section is outlined below:\n{ \u0026#34;web\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;defaults\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;appBanner\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: { // Please see top level \u0026#34;common\u0026#34; section for details }, \u0026#34;logo\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;loginPage\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;designTokens\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details } }, \u0026#34;themes\u0026#34;: [ // Your custom web themes go here, see below for details ] } } The \u0026ldquo;defaults\u0026rdquo; Similar to the top level common section, this object contains information that shall be shared among the available themes and can/should be defined only once. The top level common section first gets merged into the defaults, which then get merged into the individual themes.\nThe \u0026ldquo;appBanner\u0026rdquo; options Configures a app banner that gets shown on mobile devices and suggests downloading the native client from the respective app store. Omitting the key disables the banner.\nExample structure:\n{ \u0026#34;appBanner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ownCloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publisher\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ownCloud GmbH\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;additionalInformation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ctaText\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OPEN\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;icon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/owncloud-app-icon.png\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;appScheme\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;owncloud\u0026#34; } } title is usually your app\u0026rsquo;s name as shown in the App Store or Google Play. publisher is the app developer\u0026rsquo;s name. additionalInformation can be used to specify pricing information, such as \u0026ldquo;FREE\u0026rdquo; or a catchphrase like \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t miss out on our awesome app!\u0026rdquo;. ctaText refers to the text in the call to action button on the right side. The icon directive may be used to specify your own app icon. icon links the icon to be displayed as a preview for the final app icon within the app banner appScheme is the first part of the URL that is used to tell the mobile OS which app to open, so using ownCloud will generate links such as owncloud://yourdomain.com/f/2b61b822.... The \u0026ldquo;logo\u0026rdquo; options Here, you can specify the images to be used in the \u0026quot;topbar\u0026quot;, for the \u0026quot;favicon\u0026quot; and on the \u0026quot;login\u0026quot; page. Various formats are supported and it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to decide which one fits your use case best.\n\u0026#34;logo\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;topbar\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/logo.svg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;favicon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/favicon.jpg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;login\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/logo.svg\u0026#34; }, The \u0026ldquo;loginPage\u0026rdquo; options Using the \u0026quot;autoRedirect\u0026quot; boolean, you can specify whether the user is shown a login page before possible getting redirected to your LDAP/OIDC/OAuth provider. If it is set to true, you can set the background image for said login page by providing an image file in the \u0026quot;backgroundImg\u0026quot; option.\n\u0026#34;loginPage\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoRedirect\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;backgroundImg\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/loginBackground.jpg\u0026#34; }, The \u0026ldquo;designTokens\u0026rdquo; options To further customize your ownCloud instance, you can provide your own styles. To give you an idea of how a working design system looks like, feel free to head over to the ownCloud design tokens for inspiration.\nHint: All the variables are initialized using the ownCloud design tokens and then overwritten by your theme variables. Therefore, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to provide all the variables and can use the default ownCloud colors as a fallback.\nIn general, the theme loader looks for a designTokens key inside your theme configuration. Inside the designTokens, it expects to find a colorPalette, fontSizes and spacing collection. The structure is outlined below:\n\u0026#34;designTokens\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;breakpoints\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;colorPalette\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;fontFamily\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, // Please see below for details \u0026#34;fontSizes\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;sizes\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details }, \u0026#34;spacing\u0026#34;: { // Please see below for details } } Breakpoints If you\u0026rsquo;d like to set different breakpoints than the default ones in the ownCloud design system, you can set them using theming variables.\nBreakpoint variables get prepended with --oc-breakpoint-, so e.g. \u0026ldquo;large-default\u0026rdquo; creates the custom CSS property --oc-breakpoint-large-default.\n{ \u0026#34;breakpoints\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xsmall-max\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;small-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;small-max\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;medium-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;medium-max\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;large-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;large-max\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xlarge\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Colors For the color values, you can use any valid CSS color format, e.g. hex (#fff), rgb (rgb(255,255,255)) or color names (white).\nColor variables get prepended with --oc-color-, so e.g. \u0026ldquo;background-default\u0026rdquo; creates the custom CSS property --oc-color-background-default.\nAgain, you can use the ownCloud design tokens as a reference implementation.\n{ \u0026#34;colorPalette\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;background-accentuate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;background-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;background-highlight\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;background-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;border\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input-bg\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input-border\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input-text-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;input-text-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-brand-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-brand-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-brand-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-brand-contrast\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-danger-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-danger-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-danger-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-danger-contrast\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-inverse-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-inverse-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-inverse-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-passive-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-passive-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-passive-hover-outline\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-passive-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-passive-contrast\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-muted-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-gradient\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-gradient-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-primary-contrast\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-success-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-success-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-success-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-success-contrast\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-warning-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-warning-hover\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-warning-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;swatch-warning-contrast\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text-inverse\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;text-muted\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Font sizes You can change the default, large and medium font sizes according to your needs. If you need more customization options regarding font sizes, please open an issue on GitHub with a detailed description.\nFont size variables get prepended with --oc-font-size-, so e.g. \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; creates the custom CSS property --oc-font-size-default.\n{ \u0026#34;fontSizes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;large\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;medium\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Font family You can change the font family according to your needs. The font family gets written into the --oc-font-family CSS variable.\n{ \u0026#34;fontFamily\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } Please note that you also need to make the font available as a font-face via CSS.\nSizes Use sizing variables to change various UI elements, such as icon and logo appearance, table row or checkbox sizes, according to your needs. If you need more customization options regarding sizes, please open an issue on GitHub with a detailed description.\nSize variables get prepended with --oc-size-, so e.g. \u0026ldquo;icon-default\u0026rdquo; creates the custom CSS property --oc-size-icon-default.\n{ \u0026#34;sizes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;form-check-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;height-small\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;height-table-row\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;icon-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;max-height-logo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;max-width-logo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;width-medium\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tiles-default\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tiles-resize-step\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Spacing Use the six spacing options (xsmall | small | medium | large | xlarge | xxlarge) to create a more (or less) condensed version of the user interface. If you need more customization options regarding sizes, please open an issue on GitHub with a detailed description.\nSpacing variables get prepended with --oc-space-, so e.g. \u0026ldquo;xlarge\u0026rdquo; creates the custom CSS property --oc-space-xlarge.\n{ \u0026#34;spacing\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xsmall\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;small\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;medium\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;large\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xlarge\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;xxlarge\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Actual Themes Apart from the defaults, you need to provide one or more themes in the themes key within the web-clients in your theme.json. As a reminder, the general structure should be:\n{ \u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;clients\u0026#34;: { ..., \u0026#34;web\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;defaults\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;themes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;isDark\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Light Theme\u0026#34;, } ] } } } Again, both the global common section as well as the defaults will get merged into your themes, but locally provided information takes precedence.\nRequired information\nname for the visible name in the theme switcher and to save the current theme to localStorage isDark to provide the user agent with additional information Optional information\nappBanner see section above common see section above designTokens see section above logo see section above loginPage see section above Extendability If you define different key-value pairs inside any of the objects (breakpoints, colorPalette, fontSizes, sizes, spacing) in \u0026quot;designTokens\u0026quot;, they will get loaded and initialized as CSS custom properties but don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily take any effect in the user interface. This gives you an opportunity to, for example, customize extensions from within the theme in the web runtime (and not the extension itself).\nExample theme A full template for your custom theme is provided below, and you can use the instructions above to set it up according to your needs:\n{ \u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ownCloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;slogan\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ownCloud – A safe home for all your data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;logo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;themes/owncloud/assets/logo.svg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;urls\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;accessDeniedHelp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;imprint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;privacy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;

You can follow these steps to get started:\nStart Jaeger by using the all-in-one docker image: docker run -d --name jaeger \\ -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 \\ -p 5775:5775/udp \\ -p 6831:6831/udp \\ -p 6832:6832/udp \\ -p 5778:5778 \\ -p 16686:16686 \\ -p 14268:14268 \\ -p 14250:14250 \\ -p 9411:9411 \\ jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.17 Every single oCIS service has its own environment variables for enabling and configuring tracing. You can enable and configure tracing on each service individually. For example, enable tracing in Reva when starting the oCIS single binary like this: REVA_TRACING_ENABLED=true \\ REVA_TRACING_ENDPOINT=localhost:6831 \\ REVA_TRACING_COLLECTOR=http://localhost:14268/api/traces \\ ./bin/ocis server Enabling and configuring tracing on oCIS itself will forward the configuration to all services: OCIS_TRACING_ENABLED=true \\ OCIS_TRACING_ENDPOINT=localhost:6831 \\ OCIS_TRACING_COLLECTOR=http://localhost:14268/api/traces \\ ./bin/ocis server If you want to set individual tracing configuration for each service, make sure to set OCIS_TRACING_ENABLED=false. Make the actual request that you want to trace. Open up the Jaeger UI to analyze request traces.

This mode is supposed to be used in the context of selecting or sharing resources. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for even more minimalistic approach, you can take a look at the File picker.\nGetting started To integrate ownCloud Web into your application, add an iframe element pointing to your ownCloud Web deployed instance with additional query parameter embed=true.\n\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;web-url\u0026gt;?embed=true\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; Communication To establish seamless cross-origin communication between the embedded instance and the parent application, our approach involves emitting events using the postMessage method. These events can be conveniently captured by utilizing the standard window.addEventListener('message', listener) pattern.\nTarget origin By default, the postMessage method does not specify the targetOrigin parameter. However, it is recommended best practice to explicitly pass in the URI of the iframe origin (not the parent application). To enhance security, you can specify this value by modifying the config option options.embed.messagesOrigin.\nEvents To maintain uniformity and ease of handling, each event encapsulates the same structure within its payload: { name: string, data: any }.\nName Data Description owncloud-embed:select Resource[] Gets emitted when user selects resources or location via the select action owncloud-embed:share string[] Gets emitted when user selects resources and shares them via the \u0026ldquo;Share links\u0026rdquo; action owncloud-embed:cancel null Gets emitted when user attempts to close the embedded instance via \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo; action Example \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://my-owncloud-web-instance?embed=true\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function selectEventHandler(event) { if (event.data?.name !== \u0026#39;owncloud-embed:select\u0026#39;) { return } const resources = event.data.data doSomethingWithSelectedResources(resources) } window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, selectEventHandler) \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Location picker By default, the Embed mode allows users to select resources. In certain cases (e.g. uploading a file), this needs to be changed to allow selecting a location. This can be achieved by running the embed mode with additional parameter embed-target=location. With this parameter, resource selection is disabled and the selected resources array always includes the current folder as the only item.\nExample \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://my-owncloud-web-instance?embed=true\u0026amp;embed-target=location\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function selectEventHandler(event) { if (event.data?.name !== \u0026#39;owncloud-embed:select\u0026#39;) { return } const resources = event.data.data[0] doSomethingWithSelectedResources(resources) } window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, selectEventHandler) \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Delegate authentication If you already have a valid access_token that can be used to call the API from within the Embed mode and do not want to force the user to authenticate again, you can delegate the authentication. Delegating authentication will disable internal login form in ownCloud Web and will instead use events to obtain the token and update it.\nConfiguration To allow authentication delegation, you need to set the config option options.embed.delegateAuthentication to true. This can be achieved via query parameter embed-delegate-authentication=true. Because we are using the postMessage method to communicate across different origins, it is best practice to verify that the event originated from a known origin and not from some malicious site. We highly recommend to allow this check in production environments. You can enable it by setting the config option options.embed.delegateAuthenticationOrigin via query parameter embed-delegate-authentication-origin=my-origin. The value of this parameter will be compared against the MessageEvent.origin value and if they do not match, the token will be rejected.\nEvents Opening Embed mode As already mentioned, we\u0026rsquo;re using the postMessage method to allow communication between the Embed mode and the parent application. When the Embed mode is opened for the first time, the user gets redirected to the /web-oidc-callback page where a message with payload { name: 'owncloud-embed:request-token', data: undefined } is sent to request the access_token from the parent application. The parent application should set an event listener before opening the Embed mode and once received, it should send a message with payload { name: 'owncloud-embed:update-token', data: { access_token: '\u0026lt;bearer-token\u0026gt;' } }. Once the Embed mode receives this message, it will save the token in the application state and will automatically authenticate the user.\nWhen passing the token in the message payload, use only the token itself without Bearer string as that will be added automatically in the Embed mode. To save unnecessary duplication of messages with only different names, the name in the message payload above is exactly the same for both the initial authentication and subsequent token updates after renewal. Updating the token When authentication is delegated, the automatic renewal of the token inside of ownCloud Web is disabled. In order to update the token, a listener is created which awaits a message with payload { name: 'owncloud-embed:update-token', data: { access_token: '\u0026lt;bearer-token\u0026gt;' } }. The token will then be replaced inside of the Embed mode automatically.\n","description":"Getting started Communication Target origin Events Example Location picker Example Delegate authentication Configuration Events Opening Embed mode Updating the token The ownCloud Web can be consumed by another application in a stripped down version called \u0026ldquo;Embed mode\u0026rdquo;.

For convenience, we will use the free service from the Ubernauten \u0026ndash; Join us here: Uberspace Registration Page. They offer free of charge (for the first month) web hosting.\nIn this documentation, we are assuming you already have an account there and it is configured for SSH access. This guide is using \u0026ldquo;ocis.uber.space\u0026rdquo; as a domain at Uberspace, version 4.0.3 of Infinite Scale and the local user \u0026ldquo;owncloud\u0026rdquo;. Make sure you adapt the example code and scripts mentioned in this page to your needs Both username and domain will be set when you sign in to Uberspace.\nInstalling ownCloud Infinite Scale on Ubernauten is pretty straigt-forward, you can do it in three steps that take less than a minute: Here\u0026rsquo;s a short video that shows how fast the whole process actually is - thanks to Infinite Scale\u0026rsquo;s cloud native architecture. ownCloud Infinite Scale in 50 seconds\nThree Steps to your Infinite UberSpace Download the Infinite Scale binary and make it executable curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/stable/4.0.3/ocis-4.0.3-linux-amd64 --output ocis chmod +x ocis Set some environment variables related to Uberspace (Make sure you fill in YOUR domain!) uberspace web backend set / --http --port 9200 export OCIS_URL=https://ocis.uber.space export PROXY_TLS=false export PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9200 export PROXY_LOG_LEVEL=debug Start the ocis binary, first with the parameter init for initial configuration. This will also give you your unique login password for the user admin. Once finished, call ocis start: ./ocis init ./ocis server Wait a few seconds, now you can visit the url of your uberspace server and login:\nTo make it easier (and faster), here\u0026rsquo;s the commands in a script called ocis.install:\n#!/bin/bash # This file is named ocis.install # It downloads ocis, configures the environment varibles and starts # ownCloud Infinite Scale on a ubernauten account. You can run it in your home directory curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/stable/4.0.3/ocis-4.0.3-linux-amd64 --output ocis chmod +x ocis uberspace web backend set / --http --port 9200 export OCIS_URL=https://ocis.uber.space export PROXY_TLS=false export PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9200 export PROXY_LOG_LEVEL=debug ./ocis init ./ocis server Service Management with Supervisord If you want ocis to run continuously, you need to configure supervisord (http://supervisord.org) which is the tool Uberspace is using for service management.\nYou can start and stop services with supervisorctl, it will (re)read configuration files it finds in your home directory, under etc/services.d/, in .ini files. The content of these files is very simple, you only have to enter three lines, here is the example for Infinite Scale in /home/owncloud/etc/services.d/ocis.ini.\n[program:ocis] command=\u0026#34;/home/owncloud/ocis.start\u0026#34; startsecs=60 ocis.start is a script that combines all of the commands above except for the download of the ocis binary. It looks like this:\n#!/bin/bash # This file is named ocis.start. # It sets environment variables needed for uber.space needed for Infinite Scale /usr/bin/uberspace web backend set / --http --port 9200 \u0026amp; export OCIS_URL=https://ocis.uber.space export PROXY_TLS=false export PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9200 export PROXY_LOG_LEVEL=debug /home/owncloud/ocis server There are four supervisorctl commands that you will find useful (many more can be found in its documentation). You can use supervisorctl status to check which services managed by supervisorctl are running, a supervisorctl reread will be necessary after you changed the ini files, an update is applying changes, and supervisorctl stop will stop a running service:\n[owncloud@ocis ~]$ supervisorctl status ocis RUNNING pid 9813, uptime 0:01:40 [owncloud@ocis ~]$ supervisorctl reread No config updates to processes [owncloud@ocis ~]$ supervisorctl update You can find all information on Supervisord and supervisorctl on its website: Running Supervisord.\nUpdating ownCloud Infinite Scale Updating the ocis binary is simple: When a new version comes to life, just download the new ocis binary from the download server, replacing the old ocis executable on your uberspace server.\nMake a backup of your data and make sure you have read and understood the release notes of your new version , especially the \u0026ldquo;breaking changes\u0026rdquo; section before starting the binary.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry, you can always go back to the older version you had installed, there\u0026rsquo;s a long list of older versions available for download.\nMind that if you want to re-configure, re-install or start a new version of ocis, make sure you have stopped supervisorctl from restarting ocis. Enter supervisorctl stop ocis, followed by a killall -9 ocis to make sure no ocis version is still running.\nWiping and Clean Restart from Scratch This little script is removing your ocis installation (and all of your data!), replacing it with a new, clean ocis installation. Be careful and only use it for testing purposes. Specify your desired ocis version in the curl command.\n#!/bin/bash # This file is named ocis.reinstall # It deletes the old ocis installation, fetches a new binary and starts ocis. rm -rf .ocis curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/stable/4.0.3/ocis-4.0.3-linux-amd64 --output ocis chmod +x ocis uberspace web backend set / --http --port 9200 export OCIS_URL=https://ocis.uber.space export PROXY_TLS=false export PROXY_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:9200 export PROXY_LOG_LEVEL=debug ./ocis init ./ocis server Troubleshooting SSL/TLS Certificates: Every Uberspace comes with its own HTTPS certificate via Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt.

Infinite Scale is built by microservices. That means many calls to \u0026ldquo;functions\u0026rdquo; in the code are remote calls.\nBasically we have two different API \u0026ldquo;universes\u0026rdquo;: HTTP and gRPC.\nFor inter-service-communication we are using mostly gRPC calls because it has some advantages. In the future, clients may decide to use gRPC directly to make use of these advantages.\nHTTP HTTP APIs are mostly used for client \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; server communication. Modern applications are embracing a RESTful software architecture style. REST APIs are using the HTTP protocol to transfer data between clients and servers. All our clients talk to the Server using HTTP APIs. This has legacy reasons and is well-supported across many platforms and technologies. Infinite Scale uses an HTTP API gateway to route client requests to the correct service.\nOpenAPI It is best practise to define APIs and their behavior by a spec. We are using the OpenAPI standard for all new APIs. The OpenAPI Specification, previously known as the Swagger Specification, is a specification for a machine-readable interface definition language for describing, producing, consuming and visualizing RESTful web services. Previously part of the Swagger framework, it became a separate project in 2016, overseen by the OpenAPI Initiative, an open-source collaboration project of the Linux Foundation. Swagger and some other tools can generate code, documentation and test cases from interface files.\nRFC Some APIs have become a de facto standard and are additionally covered by an RFC.\ngRPC In gRPC, a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local object. This makes it easier to create distributed applications based on microservices. In gRPC we can define a service and specify the methods that can be called remotely. A gRPC client has a stub that provides the same methods and types as the server. Infinite Scale uses a gRPC API Gateway to route the requests to the correct service.\nProtobuf gRPC APIs are typically defined by Protocol buffers. The different client and server stubs are created from *.proto files by code generation tools.\nVersioning There are different standards for API versioning: Through URL, through request parameter, through custom header and through content negotiation. Ocis uses the versioning by URL concept although this creates a big code footprint. The versioning follows SemVer. We update the major version number when breaking changes are needed. Clients can decide which major version they use through the request URL. The specific implementation is documented on each API.\n","description":"gRPC ocis.messages.eventhistory.v0 ocis.messages.policies.v0 ocis.messages.search.v0 ocis.messages.settings.v0 ocis.messages.store.v0 ocis.messages.thumbnails.v0 ocis.services.eventhistory.v0 ocis.services.policies.v0 ocis.services.search.v0 ocis.services.settings.v0 ocis.services.store.v0 ocis.services.thumbnails.v0 Http LibreGraph Spaces Users Groups WebDAV Resumable Upload Authorization Infinite Scale provides a large set of different application programming interfaces (APIs).

It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.\nAdvantages of gRPC Performance gRPC uses http/2 by default and is faster than REST. When using protocol buffers for encoding, the information comes on and off the wire much faster than JSON. Latency is an important factor in distributed systems. JSON encoding creates a noticeable factor of latency. For distributed systems and high data loads, gRPC can actually make an important difference. Other than that, gRPC supports multiple calls via the same channel and the connections are bidirectional. A single connection can transmit requests and responses at the same time. gRPC keeps connections open to reuse the same connection again which prevents latency and saves bandwidth. Robustness gRPC empowers better relationships between clients and servers. The rules of communication are strictly enforced. That is not the case in REST calls, where the client and the server can send and receive anything they like and hopefully the other end understands what to do with it. In gRPC, to make changes to the communication, both client and server need to change accordingly. This prevents mistakes specially in microservice architectures. Debuggability gRPC requests are re-using the same context and can be tracked or traced across multiple service boundaries. This helps to identify slow calls and see what is causing delays. It is possible to cancel requests which cancels them on all involved services. Microservices gRPC has been evolving and has become the best option for communication between microservices because of its unmatched performance and its polyglot nature. One of the biggest strengths of microservices is the freedom of programming languages and technologies. By using gRPC we can leverage all the advantages of strictly enforced communication standards combined with freedom of choice between different programming languages - whichever would fit best. http/2 protocol buffers reusable connections multi language support CS3 APIs The CS3 APIs connect storages and application providers.\nThe CS3 APIs follow Google and Uber API design guidelines, specially on error handling and naming convention. You can read more about these guidelines at https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/ and https://github.com/uber/prototool/blob/dev/style/README.md.\nThe CS3 APIs use Protocol Buffers version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages.\n","description":"ocis.messages.eventhistory.v0 ocis.messages.policies.v0 ocis.messages.search.v0 ocis.messages.settings.v0 ocis.messages.store.v0 ocis.messages.thumbnails.v0 ocis.services.eventhistory.v0 ocis.services.policies.v0 ocis.services.search.v0 ocis.services.settings.v0 ocis.services.store.v0 ocis.services.thumbnails.v0 Remote Procedure Calls gRPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment.

There will be no supported releases in terms of us guaranteeing production readiness. We will do releases every 3 weeks, and they will sometimes only include bugfixes, but also introduce new features or optimizations.\nWe will be fixing bugs if you report them and truly appreciate every report and contribution. Depending on the individual case, we will publish bugfix releases or add the fix to the next minor release.\nWe are going to stick to major version 1 until we feel confident about running oCIS in production environments. As a consequence of this we cannot raise the major version, like SemVer requires it, even if we need to introduce breaking changes. We will do our best to avoid breaking changes. If there is no way to circumvent this, we will add an automatic migration or at least point out manual migration steps, since we as oCIS developers are already using oCIS on a personal basis. The best place to see if a breaking change happens is our changelog which is available for every release. If things are not working out for you please contact us immediately.

If you would like to access oCIS remotely please refer to the Basic Remote Setup section. Especially to the notes about setting the PROXY_HTTP_ADDR and OCIS_URL environment variables. You can find more deployment examples in the deployment section.\nBinaries You can find the latest official release of oCIS at our download mirror or on GitHub. The latest build from the master branch can be found at our download mirrors daily section. Pre-Releases are available at our download mirrors testing section.\nTo run oCIS as binary you need to download it first and then run the following commands. For this example, assuming version 2.0.0-beta.5 of oCIS running on a Linux AMD64 host:\n# download curl https://download.owncloud.com/ocis/ocis/testing/2.0.0-beta.5/ocis-2.0.0-beta.5-linux-amd64 --output ocis # make binary executable chmod +x ocis # initialize a minimal oCIS configuration ./ocis init # run with demo users IDM_CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true ./ocis server The default primary storage location is ~/.ocis or /var/lib/ocis depending on the packaging format and your operating system user. You can change that value by configuration.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re using oCIS with self-signed certificates, you need to answer the question for certificate checking with \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; or set the environment variable OCIS_INSECURE=true, in order to make oCIS work. oCIS by default relies on Multicast DNS (mDNS), usually via avahi-daemon. If your system has a firewall, make sure mDNS is allowed in your active zone. Open Files on macOS The start command ./ocis server starts a runtime which runs all oCIS services in one process. On MacOS we have very low limits for open files. oCIS needs more than the default 256. Please raise the limit to 1024 by typing ulimit -n 1024 within the same cli session where you start ocis from. Docker Docker images for oCIS are available on Docker Hub.\nThe latest tag always reflects the current master branch.\ndocker pull owncloud/ocis docker run --rm -it -v ocis-config:/etc/ocis owncloud/ocis init docker run --rm -p 9200:9200 -v ocis-config:/etc/ocis -v ocis-data:/var/lib/ocis -e IDM_CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true owncloud/ocis When you\u0026rsquo;re using oCIS with self-signed certificates, you need to set the environment variable OCIS_INSECURE=true, in order to make oCIS work. When you\u0026rsquo;re creating the demo users by setting IDM_CREATE_DEMO_USERS=true, you need to be sure that this instance is not used in production because the passwords are public. We are using named volumes for the oCIS configuration and oCIS data in the above example (-v ocis-config:/etc/ocis -v ocis-data:/var/lib/ocis). You could instead also use host bind-mounts instead, eg. -v /some/host/dir:/var/lib/ocis.\nYou cannot use bind mounts on MacOS, since extended attributes are not supported (owncloud/ocis#182, moby/moby#1070).\nUsage Login to ownCloud Web Open https://localhost:9200 and login using one of the demo accounts.\nBasic Management Commands The oCIS single binary contains multiple extensions and the ocis command helps you to manage them.
