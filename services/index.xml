      <description>When a new service gets introduced, this checklist is a good startingpoint for things that need to be completed before the service gets published (merged). This list is without claim of completeness or correct sort order.
New Service Checklist     Use this checklist with copy/paste in your PR - right from the beginning. It renders correctly in your PR.
- [ ] Provide a README.md for that service in the root folder of that service.</description>

      <title>Port Ranges</title>

      <description>oCIS services often need a port to expose their services to other services or the outside world. As users may have many different extensions running on the same machine, we should track port usage in the oCIS ecosystem. In the best case we ensure that each extension uses a non colliding port range, to make life of users easier.
This page tracks the knowingly used port ranges.
Feel free to &amp;ldquo;reserve&amp;rdquo; a free port range when you&amp;rsquo;re developing an extension by adding your extension to the list (see the edit button in the top right corner).</description>
