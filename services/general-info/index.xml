      <description>Any CLI command that is added to Infinite Scale must be documented in the dev docs and the admin docs. Note that the admin docs mainly differentiate between online and offline commands as the docs structure is different. Any command documented in the dev docs is properly integrated into the admin docs. The following description is for dev docs, admin docs derive from it.&#xA;Note that ANY CLI command needs documentation, but it can be decided that a CLI command will not be added to the admin docs (the reasons should be really valid for such a case).</description>

      <description>Services can have texts that need to be translated. These translations will be shown in the ownCloud Web UI. Compared to web, these translations are:&#xA;Independent of ownCloud Web on Transifex. Are located in the ownCloud Transifex Project. Have a name starting with ocis- for ease of identification. The process for synchronisation with Transifex is already setup and nothing needs to be done here. For any translation, it is necessary to set it up in the respective service and tell to sync it.</description>

      <description>To be able to communicate with each other, services need to register in a common registry.&#xA;Configuration nats-js-kv (Default) kubernetes memory Deprecated Registries Configuration The type of registry to use can be configured with the MICRO_REGISTRY environment variable. Supported values are:&#xA;nats-js-kv (Default) Set the environment variable to nats-js-kv or leave it empty to use a nats-js key value store as registry.&#xA;Note: If not running build-in nats, MICRO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS needs to be set to the address of the nats-js cluster, which is the same value as OCIS_EVENTS_ENDPOINT.</description>

      <description>When a new service gets introduced, this checklist is a good starting point for things that need to be completed before the service gets published (merged). This list is without claim of completeness or correct sort order.&#xA;New Service Checklist Use this checklist with copy/paste in your PR - right from the beginning. It renders correctly in your PR.&#xA;- [ ] Services MUST NOT be named `extended` or `global`. These are reserved names for the automated documentation process.</description>

      <description>This section contains information on general topics&#xA;GRPC Maximum Message Size ocis is using grpc for inter-service communication. When having a folder with a lot of files (25.000+, the size does not matter) and doing a PROPFIND on that folder, the server will run into errors. This is because the grpc message body becomes to big. With introduction of the envvar OCIS_GRPC_MAX_RECEIVED_MESSAGE_SIZE, the max size for the grpc body can be raised.</description>

      <title>Port Ranges</title>

      <description>oCIS services often need a port to expose their services to other services or the outside world. As users may have many different extensions running on the same machine, we should track port usage in the oCIS ecosystem. In the best case, we ensure that each extension uses a non-colliding port range, to make life easier for users.&#xA;This page tracks the knowingly used port ranges.&#xA;Feel free to &amp;ldquo;reserve&amp;rdquo; a free port range when you&amp;rsquo;re developing an extension by adding your extension to the list (see the edit button in the top right corner).</description>
