it is most easiest to create the added/removed/deprecated adoc tables using
the python script in docs/helpers/changes_envvars.py

the script creates based on variables that need to be adapted according your needs
all files necessary. finally you only MUST handle xrefs manually, see existing files
for an example for how to do so.
