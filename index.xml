      <description>Status: superseded by ADR-0003 Deciders: @butonic, @felixboehm, @micbar, @pmaier1 Date: 2020-06-15 Technical Story: persist accounts&#xA;Context and Problem Statement To attach metadata like shares to users ownCloud relies on persistent, non-reassignable, unique identifiers for users (and files). Email und username can change when a user changes his name. But even the OIDC sub+iss combination may change when the IdP changes. While there is an account porting protocol that describes how a relying party (RP) such as ownCloud should behave, it still requires the RP to maintain its own user identifiers.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @felixboehm Date: 2020-08-21 Technical Story: File system based indexing&#xA;Context and Problem Statement To set up High Availability (HA) or a geo-replicated setup we need to persist accounts in a distributed way. To efficiently query the accounts by email or username, and not only by id, they need to be indexed. Unfortunately, the bleve index we currently store locally on disk cannot be shared by multiple instances, preventing a scale out deployment.</description>

We need to provide a concept how to migrate from oC10 to oCIS.&#xA;Decision Drivers Do not lose file blob or metadata. To prevent a sync surge from clients the etag for files should be migrated. To prevent internal links from breaking or pointing to wrong files the file id of existing files needs to be migrated.</description>

      <description>Cloud Native Why do we recommend to work with containers?&#xA;Lightweight Containers are more lightweight than VMs. It is easier to work with shared volumes and networks because they are isolated from the host system.&#xA;Dependencies The container images have all dependencies installed and the maintainer takes care for keeping them up-to-date.&#xA;Scaling In addition to that, containers help with scaling. You can run multiple instances of one container and distribute them across hosts.</description>

Separating account management at the service level is pragmatic and allows for fast iterations, but also steadily accumulates inconsistencies and bloats technical debt.&#xA;Decision Drivers Reduce number of network calls.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @refs, @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-04-19 Technical Story: Introduce Named Services.&#xA;Context and Problem Statement Reva relies heavily on config files. A known implication of this approach are having to know a-priori where a service is running (host + port). We want to move away from hardcoded values and rely instead on named services for service discovery. Furthermore, we would like both platforms (Reva + oCIS) to have the same source of truth at any given time, not having one to notify the other whenever a service status changes.</description>

      <description>Using the standard library To write a unit test for your package, create a file with the _test.go suffix. For example, if you have a package foo with a file foo.go, you can create a file foo_test.go in the same directory. The test file should have the same package name as the package being tested. By doing this, you can access all exported and unexported identifiers of the package. It is a good practice to keep the test file in the same package as the code being tested.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @hodyroff, @pmaier1, @fschade Date: 2021-06-30 Context and Problem Statement There should be a way to impose certain limitations in areas of the code that require licensing. This document researches an approach to achieve this goal, while limiting the scope to the enforcement side of it. The architecture for a policy system must be composed of 2 parts:&#xA;License creation and validation Enforcement It is desirable to keep both systems isolated, since the implementation of the latter has to be done within the constraints of the codebase.</description>

      <description>Resetting a lost administrator password By default, when using oCIS with the builtin IDM an ad generates the user admin (DN uid=admin,ou=users,o=libregraph-idm) if, for any reason, the password of that user is lost, it can be reset using the resetpassword sub-command:&#xA;ocis idm resetpassword It will prompt for a new password and set the password of that user accordingly. Note: As this command is accessing the idm database directly will only work while ocis is not running and nothing else is accessing database.</description>

The CS3org WOPI server implements a file based locking in order to lock files. This ADR discusses if this approach is ok for the general availability of oCIS or if changes are needed.&#xA;Decision Drivers Is the current situation acceptable for the GA Is locking needed or can we have oCIS / REVA without locking Considered Options File based locking No locking CS3 API locking Decision Outcome For the GA we chose option 2.</description>

      <description>A namespace is a set of paths with a common prefix. Depending on the endpoint you are talking to you will encounter a different kind of namespace: In ownCloud 10 all paths are considered relative to the users home. The CS3 API uses a global namespace and the storage providers use a local namespace with paths relative to the storage providers root.&#xA;The different paths in the namespaces need to be translated while passing references from service to service.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @rhafer Date: 2022-02-08 Context and Problem Statement oCIS needs to be integrated with various external Authentication and Identity Management Systems. Usually oCIS will have no administrative access to such a system and we will not be allowed to reconfigure it to suit our needs (e.g. we will not be able to enhance the schema of an already existing LDAP Directory). In most of the cases our access will be read-only.</description>

      <description>TODO add this to the storage overview? or is this a different part? That should be started as a separate service ? And documented elsewhere, e.g. in the accounts?&#xA;User and Group provisioning In oc10 users are identified by a username, which cannot change, because it is used as a foreign key in several tables.

      <title>20. File Search Query Language</title>

      <guid>https://owncloud.dev/ocis/adr/0020-file-search-query-language/</guid>
      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @c0rby, @kulmann, @felix-schwarz, @JammingBen Date: 2023-06-23 Context and Problem Statement From the users perspective, the interface to search is just a single form field where the user enters one or more search terms. The minimum expectation is that the search returns file names and links to files that:&#xA;have a file name that contains at least one of the search terms contain at least one of the search terms in the file contents have metadata that is equal or contains one of the search terms Decision Drivers The standard user should not be bothered by a query syntax The power user should also be able to narrow his search with an efficient and flexible syntax We need to consider different backend technologies which we need to access through an abstraction layer Using different indexing systems should lead to a slightly different feature set without changing the syntax completely Considered Options KQL - Keyword Query Language Simple Query Lucene Query Language Solr Query Language Elasticsearch Query Language Decision Outcome Chosen option: KQL - Keyword Query Language, because it enables advanced search across all platforms.</description>

      <description>Beta Testing This document is supposed to give you some ideas how and what to test on ocis. It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to be an extensive list of all tests to be done, rather it should help you, as beta-tester, to get started and enable you to get creative and create your own test-cases. Derive from these examples, be creative, do unusual and unconventional things, to try to break things.</description>

      <description>WebDAV with Basic Authentication Basic Authentication is disabled by default in oCIS because of security considerations. In order to make the following Rclone commands work the oCIS administrator needs to enable Basic Authentication e.g. by setting the environment variable PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH to true.&#xA;Please consider to use Rclone with OpenID Connect instead.&#xA;For the usage of a WebDAV remote with Rclone see also the Rclone documentation&#xA;Configure the WebDAV remote First of all we need to set up our credentials and the WebDAV remote for Rclone.</description>

      <description>WebDAV with OpenID Connect Rclone itself is not able to open and maintain an OpenID Connect session. But it is able to still use OpenID Connect for authentication by leveraging a so called OIDC-agent.&#xA;Setting up the OIDC-agent You need to install the OIDC-agent from your OS&amp;rsquo; package repository (e.g. Debian or MacOS).&#xA;Configuring the OIDC-agent Run the following command to add a OpenID Connect profile to your OIDC-agent. It will open the login page of OpenID Connect identity provider where you need to log in if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an active session.</description>

      <description>This section contains information on general topics&#xA;GRPC Maximum Message Size ocis is using grpc for inter-service communication. When having a folder with a lot of files (25.000+, the size does not matter) and doing a PROPFIND on that folder, the server will run into errors. This is because the grpc message body becomes to big. With introduction of the envvar OCIS_GRPC_MAX_RECEIVED_MESSAGE_SIZE, the max size for the grpc body can be raised.</description>

      <description>oCIS services often need a port to expose their services to other services or the outside world. As users may have many different extensions running on the same machine, we should track port usage in the oCIS ecosystem. In the best case, we ensure that each extension uses a non-colliding port range, to make life easier for users.&#xA;This page tracks the knowingly used port ranges.&#xA;Feel free to &amp;ldquo;reserve&amp;rdquo; a free port range when you&amp;rsquo;re developing an extension by adding your extension to the list (see the edit button in the top right corner).</description>

      <description>TLS Server Certificates By default IDM generates a self-signed certificate and key on first startup to be able to provide TLS protected services. The certificate is stored in idm/ldap.crt inside the oCIS base data directory. The key is in idm/ldap.key in the same directory. You can use a custom server certificate by setting the IDM_LDAPS_CERT and IDM_LDAPS_KEY.&#xA;Default / Demo Users On startup IDM creates a set of default services users that are needed internally to provide access to IDM to other oCIS services.</description>

Because of that, it is not possible at the moment to do any kind of easy theming and including custom theme means again compiling custom assets.</description>

      <description>Infinite Scale has implemented OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OIDC defines a discovery mechanism, called OpenID Connect Discovery, where an OpenID server publishes its metadata at a well-known URL, typically:&#xA;https://ocis.test/.well-known/openid-configuration&#xA;This URL returns a JSON listing of the OpenID/OAuth endpoints, supported scopes and claims, public keys used to sign the tokens, and other details. The clients can use this information to construct a request to the OpenID server. The field names and values are defined in the OpenID Connect Discovery Specification.</description>

      <description>Infinite Scale supports the tus resumable-upload protocol, which is a robust, modular, and open protocol designed to resume large file uploads reliably over HTTP. In situations where file uploads might be interrupted due to network issues, browser crashes, or other unforeseen interruptions, tus ensures that uploads can be resumed from the point of failure without losing data. This documentation shows some basic examples, refer tus official site for more details.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @c0rby Date: 2023-01-18 Context and Problem Statement There are three levels of security checks in a microservice web application that uses OpenID Connect:&#xA;scope claims limit the possible operations to what the user (or admin on behalf of the organization) consented to service authorization limit the possible operations to what specific services are allowed to do, on behalf of users or even without them permission checks limit the possible operations to the relationships between subject, permission and resource allow This ADR deals with a prerequisite for service authorization: service accounts.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @theonering, @micbar, @dragotin Date: 2023-10-17 Context and Problem Statement ownCloud Infinite Scale is supposed to become a data platform and as such it needs to provide access to metadata. Currently only metadata common to all file types (filesize, mime-type, &amp;hellip;) is stored in the index and the metadata storage. We want to make other file type specific metadata available to consumers of our internal and external APIs.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @aduffeck, @micbar, @dragotin Date: 2023-03-15 Context and Problem Statement File metadata management is an important aspect for oCIS as a data platform. While using extended attributes to store metadata allows attaching the metadata to the actual file it causes a significant amount of syscalls that outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, filesystems are subject to different limitations in the number of extended attributes or the value size that is available.</description>

      <description>Status: draft Deciders: @butonic, @fschade, @aduffeck Date: 2024-02-09 Context and Problem Statement Search is currently implemented with blevesearch, which internally uses bbolt. bbolt writes to a local file, which prevents scaling out the service.&#xA;The initial implementation used a single blevesearch index for all spaces. While this makes querying all spaces easy because the results do not need to be aggregated from multiple indexes, the single node becomes a bottleneck when answering search queries.</description>

      <description>Status: draft Deciders: @butonic, @rhafer, @dragotin Date: 2024-02-21 Context and Problem Statement The oCIS share jail is a space that contains all accepted / synced shares of a user. In contrast to a personal or project space that contains actual resources, the share jail space only contains references pointing to shared resources. The root directory only consists of mountpoints that actually represent resources in other spaces. On the WebDAV API clients expect an oc:fileid property to identify resources in other API endpoints, eg.</description>

      <description>The spaces concept allows clients to look up the space endpoints a user has access to and then do individual sync discoveries.

      <description>Development Architecture Implemented Aspects Future work oCIS intends to make the aspects of existing storage systems available as transparently as possible, but the static sync algorithm of the desktop client relies on some form of recursive change time propagation on the server side to detect changes. While this can be bolted on top of existing file systems with inotify, the kernel audit or a fuse based overlay filesystem, a storage system that already implements this aspect is preferable.</description>

      <description>The fallback sync mechanism uses the ETag to determine which part of a sync tree needs to be checked by recursively descending into folders whose ETag has changed. The ETag can be calculated using a stat() call in the filesystem and we are going to explore how many stat() calls are necessary and how the number might be reduced.&#xA;ETag propagation What does ETag propagation mean? Whenever a file changes its content or metadata the ETag or &amp;ldquo;entity tag&amp;rdquo; changes.</description>

      <description>Introduction In order for an oCIS client to access oCIS storage spaces for an End-User, the client needs to know where the oCIS instance is. oCIS uses WebFinger RFC7033 to locate the oCIS instance for an End-User.&#xA;This discovery is optional. If the client has another way of discovering the OpenID instance, e.g. when logging in with a username a static domain might be configured or the domain in the URL might be used.</description>

      <description>oCIS is all about files, sync and share - but most of the time there is more you want to do with your files, e.g. having a different view on your photo collection or editing your offices files in an online file editor. ownCloud 10 faced the same problem and solved it with applications, which can extend the functionality of ownCloud 10 in a wide range. Since oCIS is different in its architecture compared to ownCloud 10, we had to come up with a similar (yet slightly different) solution.</description>

      <description>Releasing Package Hierarchy Prerequisites Updating ocis-web Releasing The next generation Web Frontend is shipped as an oCIS Extension. The ocis-web extension is also embedded in the single binary and part of the ocis server command.&#xA;To update this package within all the deliveries, we need to update the package in the following chain from the bottom to the top.&#xA;Package Hierarchy ocis ocis-web ocis-pkg ownCloud Web Prerequisites Before updating the assets, make sure that ownCloud Web has been released first and take note of its release tag name.</description>

      <title>Migration</title>

      <description>The migration happens in subsequent stages while the service is online. First all users need to migrate to the new architecture, then the global namespace needs to be introduced. Finally, the data on disk can be migrated user by user by switching the storage driver.&#xA;@jfd: It might be easier to introduce the spaces api in oc10 and then migrate to oCIS. We cannot migrate both at the same time, the architecture to oCIS (which will change fileids) and introduce a global namespace (which requires stable fileids to let clients handle moves without redownloading).</description>

      <description>A Settings Bundle is a collection of settings, uniquely identified by the key of the extension registering the bundle and the key of the bundle itself. Its purpose is to let oCIS services define settings and make them available to users. They are dynamically rendered into forms, available in the frontend.&#xA;As of now we support five different types of settings:&#xA;boolean integer string single choice list of integers or strings multiple choice list of integers or strings Each Setting is uniquely identified by a key within the bundle.</description>

      <description>In order to use the Hello extension we need to configure and start oCIS first. After that we can run the Hello extension itself.&#xA;Configure and start oCIS You can either start oCIS from a binary or build it from source.&#xA;No matter which way you choose, we need to create a configuration file for ownCloud Web, so that the Hello extension will be loaded in the frontend. Therefore create a file web-config.</description>

      <description>oCIS provides an settings extension that other extensions can use to make settings accessible to users.&#xA;In case of the Hello extension administrator users are able to change the greeter message.&#xA;Settings are stored and presented to the user by the oCIS settings extension. It also exposes endpoints for registering and manipulating so called settings bundles.&#xA;The settings defined through settings bundles can be changed by authenticated users in ownCloud Web, if they have enough permissions to edit them.</description>

      <description>This repository provides a general guideline for creating tests for an oCIS extension. The tests can be written in various levels from unit, integration, and end-to-end. It is not essential to write tests on all these levels as it can be redundant in some cases. This repository provides a reference for all levels of tests.&#xA;Unit tests Unit tests generally live inside *_test.go files in the /pkg directory. One such example in this extension is in /pkg/service/v0/service_test.</description>

      <description>A Settings Value is the value an authenticated user has chosen for a specific setting, defined in a settings bundle.&#xA;Identifying settings values A settings value is uniquely identified by four attributes. Three of them are coming from the definition of the setting within it&amp;rsquo;s settings bundle (see Settings Bundles for an example). The fourth identifies the user.&#xA;extension: Key of the extension that registered the settings bundle, bundleKey: Key of the settings bundle, settingKey: Key of the setting as defined within the bundle, accountUuid: The UUID of the authenticated user who has saved the setting.</description>
