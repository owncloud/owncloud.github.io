      <description>Status: superseded by ADR-0003 Deciders: @butonic, @felixboehm, @micbar, @pmaier1 Date: 2020-06-15 Technical Story: persist accounts
Context and Problem Statement To attach metadata like shares to users ownCloud relies on persistent, non-reassignable, unique identifiers for users (and files). Email und username can change when a user changes his name. But even the OIDC sub+iss combination may change when the IdP changes. While there is an account porting protocol that describes how a relying party (RP) such as ownCloud should behave, it still requires the RP to maintain its own user identifiers.</description>

      <description>Components of the File picker File picker Location picker ownCloud File picker is a web component which can be integrated into existing web applications. It connects to an ownCloud server and enables a user to select resources which are then provided in a response of a fired event. Visit installation to see how to integrate the File picker into your product.
Please be aware that the File picker provides you with an object representation of the resource and not the actual content itself.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @felixboehm Date: 2020-08-21 Technical Story: File system based indexing
Context and Problem Statement To set up High Availability (HA) or a geo-replicated setup we need to persist accounts in a distributed way. To efficiently query the accounts by email or username, and not only by id, they need to be indexed. Unfortunately, the bleve index we currently store locally on disk cannot be shared by multiple instances, preventing a scale out deployment.</description>

Context and Problem Statement Migration is one of the most important topics of the oCIS story. We need to provide a concept how to migrate from oC10 to oCIS.
Decision Drivers Do not lose file blob or metadata. To prevent a sync surge from clients the etag for files should be migrated. To prevent internal links from breaking or pointing to wrong files the file id of existing files needs to be migrated.</description>

      <description>Access resources Perform actions with selected resources If using File picker as a web component, it is returning selected resources via events called select and update. To access them, you need to set an event listener where you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get them as part of the response of the callback function.

      <title>oCIS and Containers</title>

      <guid>https://owncloud.dev/ocis/guides/ocis-and-containers/</guid>
      <description>Cloud Native Why do we recommend to work with containers?
Lightweight Containers are more lightweight than VMs. It is easier to work with shared volumes and networks because they are isolated from the host system. Dependencies The container images have all dependencies installed and the maintainer takes care for keeping them up-to-date. Scaling In addition to that, containers help with scaling. You can run multiple instances of one container and distribute them across hosts.</description>

Context and Problem Statement What would be a more effective way of using network resources and handle account management within the oCIS-Reva ecosystem? Separating account management at the service level is pragmatic and allows for fast iterations, but also steadily accumulates inconsistencies and bloats technical debt.
Decision Drivers Reduce number of network calls.</description>

      <description>Variation File Picker Location Picker Actions Select Cancel It is possible to customise certain parts of the File Picker with the help of props.
Variation File picker comes in two different variations - File Picker and Location Picker. To specify which one should be used, set property variation to resource or location.
File Picker File picker variation is used to select resources from within your ownCloud instace. It is possible to select multiple files and folders.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @refs, @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @pmaier1 Date: 2021-04-19 Technical Story: Introduce Named Services.
Context and Problem Statement Reva relies heavily on config files. A known implication of this approach are having to know a-priori where a service is running (host + port). We want to move away from hardcoded values and rely instead on named services for service discovery. Furthermore, we would like both platforms (Reva + oCIS) to have the same source of truth at any given time, not having one to notify the other whenever a service status changes.</description>

Context and Problem Statement As one of the building blocks for Spaces in oCIS we plan to add an API that returns information about available spaces. This ADR discusses the API design oriented on the Microsoft Graph API.
Note: The term &amp;ldquo;spaces&amp;rdquo; is used here in the context of &amp;ldquo;a space where files can be saved&amp;rdquo;, similar to a directory.</description>

      <description>Focusing content of File Picker Initial folder load focus File Picker comes only with partial focus management. If you want to focus an element, it needs to be achieved through a code in the consuming app.
Focusing content of File Picker If you&amp;rsquo;re including File Picker as a web component, managing focus is slightly different from focusing content of any other component in the DOM tree. Since web component are living in shadow root, we need to send the focus into it.</description>

      <description>oCIS is all about files. But most of the time you want to do something with files that is beyond the basic upload, download and share behavior. Therefore, oCIS has a concept for apps, that can handle specific file types, so-called mime types.
App provider capability The capabilities endpoint (e.g. https://localhost:9200/ocs/v1.php/cloud/capabilities?format=json) gives you following capabilities which are relevant for the app provider:
{ &amp;#34;ocs&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;data&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;capabilities&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;files&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;app_providers&amp;#34;: [ { &amp;#34;enabled&amp;#34;: true, &amp;#34;version&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;1.</description>

      <description>Resetting a lost administrator password By default, when using oCIS with the builtin IDM an ad generates the user admin (DN uid=admin,ou=users,o=libregraph-idm) if, for any reason, the password of that user is lost, it can be reset using the resetpassword sub-command:
ocis idm resetpassword It will prompt for a new password and set the password of that user accordingly. Note: As this command is accessing the idm database directly will only work while ocis is not running and nothing else is accessing database.</description>

Only browser URLs are visible to end users and will be bookmarked. The currently existing and bookmarked ownCloud 10 URLs look something like this:
GET https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource&amp;amp;fileid=5472225 303 Location: https://demo.owncloud.com/apps/files/?dir=/path/to/resource When the URL contains a fileid parameter the server will look up the corresponding dir, overwriting whatever was set before the redirect.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @mstingl, @pmaier1, @fschade Date: 2021-08-17 Context and Problem Statement At the time of this writing we are in a situation where our logs have too much verbosity, rendering impossible or rather difficult to debug an instance. For this reason we are giving some care to our traces by updating dependencies from OpenCensus to OpenTelemetry.
Decision Drivers We don&amp;rsquo;t want to rely only on logs to debug an instance.</description>

      <description>A storage driver implements access to a storage system:
It maps the path and id based CS3 references to an appropriate storage system specific reference, e.g.:
eos file ids posix inodes or paths deconstructed filesystem nodes Storage providers To manage the file tree oCIS uses storage providers that are accessing the underlying storage using a storage driver. The driver can be used to change the implementation of a storage aspect to better reflect the actual underlying storage capabilities.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @hodyroff, @pmaier1, @jojowein, @dragotin, @micbar, @tbsbdr, @wkloucek Date: 2021-11-03 Context and Problem Statement At the time of this writing no locking mechanisms exists in oCIS / REVA for both directories and files. The CS3org WOPI server implements a file based locking in order to lock files. This ADR discusses if this approach is ok for the general availability of oCIS or if changes are needed.
Decision Drivers Is the current situation acceptable for the GA Is locking needed or can we have oCIS / REVA without locking Considered Options File based locking No locking CS3 API locking Decision Outcome For the GA we chose option 2.</description>

A service can send out events which are received by one or more other services. The receiving service can cause different kinds of actions based on the event by utilizing the information that the event carries.</description>

      <description>Requirements Repository structure Starting points Developing oCIS Developing extensions Requirements We want contribution to oCIS and the creation of extensions to be as easy as possible. So we are trying to reflect this in the tooling. It should be kept simple and quick to be set up.
Besides standard development tools like git and a text editor, you need the following software for development:
Go &amp;gt;= v1.21 (install instructions) pnpm (install instructions) docker (install instructions) docker-compose (install instructions) If you find tools needed besides the mentioned above, please feel free to open an issue or open a PR.</description>

      <description>A namespace is a set of paths with a common prefix. Depending on the endpoint you are talking to you will encounter a different kind of namespace: In ownCloud 10 all paths are considered relative to the users home. The CS3 API uses a global namespace and the storage providers use a local namespace with paths relative to the storage providers root.
The different paths in the namespaces need to be translated while passing references from service to service.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @dragotin, @micbar, @C0rby Date: 2022-02-04 Context and Problem Statement In addition to the file content we need to store metadata which is attached to a file. Metadata describes additional properties of a file. These properties need to be stored as close as possible to the file content to avoid inconsistencies. Metadata are key to workflows and search. We consider them as an additional value which enhances the file content.</description>

This enables you to do quick testing and development without any configuration.
If you need to access oCIS running in a docker container, on a VM or a remote machine via another hostname than localhost, you need to configure this hostname in oCIS.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @rhafer Date: 2022-02-08 Context and Problem Statement oCIS needs to be integrated with various external Authentication and Identity Management Systems. Usually oCIS will have no administrative access to such a system and we will not be allowed to reconfigure it to suit our needs (e.g. we will not be able to enhance the schema of an already existing LDAP Directory). In most of the cases our access will be read-only.</description>

      <description>TODO add this to the storage overview? or is this a different part? That should be started as a separate service ? And documented elsewhere, e.g. in the accounts?
User and Group provisioning In oc10 users are identified by a username, which cannot change, because it is used as a foreign key in several tables. For oCIS we are internally identifying users by a UUID, while using the username in the WebDAV and OCS APIs for backwards compatability.</description>

      <description>Communication is hard. And clear communication is even harder. You may encounter the following terms throughout the documentation, in the code or when talking to other developers. Just keep in mind that whenever you hear or read storage, that term needs to be clarified, because on its own it is too vague. PR welcome.
Logical concepts Resources A resource is the basic building block that oCIS manages. It can be of different types:</description>

      <description>Some architectural changes still need to be clarified or changed. Maybe an ADR is in order for all of the below.
Reva Gateway changes A dedicated shares storage provider Currently, when a user accepts a share, a cs3 reference is created in the users /home/shares folder. This reference represents the mount point of a share and can be renamed, similar to the share jail in ownCloud 10. This spreads the metadata of a share in two places:</description>

More sophisticated search capabilities are expected and can be implemented, especially based on metadata.
To trigger the indexing of a file, the search service listens to create, update and delete events on the internal event bus of oCIS.</description>

      <description>To be able to communicate with each other, services need to register in a common registry.
Configuration The type of registry to use can be configured with the MICRO_REGISTRY environment variable. Supported values are:
memory Setting the environment variable to memory starts an inmemory registry. This only works with the single binary deployment.
nats-js-kv (Default) Set the environment variable to nats-js-kv or leave it empty to use a nats-js key value store as registry.</description>

      <description>The scope of an environment variable can be derived from its name. Therefore it is important to follow the correct naming scheme to enable easy and proper identification. This is important when either:
a new local envvar is introduced. a new global envvar is added to an existing local envvar. Envvar Definition A variable that is only used in a particular service is a local envvar. A variable that is used in more than one service is a global envvar.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @micbar, @dragotin, @C0rby, @kulmann, @felix-schwarz, @JammingBen Date: 2023-06-23 Context and Problem Statement From the users perspective, the interface to search is just a single form field where the user enters one or more search terms. The minimum expectation is that the search returns file names and links to files that:
have a file name that contains at least one of the search terms contain at least one of the search terms in the file contents have metadata that is equal or contains one of the search terms Decision Drivers The standard user should not be bothered by a query syntax The power user should also be able to narrow his search with an efficient and flexible syntax We need to consider different backend technologies which we need to access through an abstraction layer Using different indexing systems should lead to a slightly different feature set without changing the syntax completely Considered Options KQL - Keyword Query Language Simple Query Lucene Query Language Solr Query Language Elasticsearch Query Language Decision Outcome Chosen option: KQL - Keyword Query Language, because it enables advanced search across all platforms.</description>

      <description>WebDAV with Basic Authentication Basic Authentication is disabled by default in oCIS because of security considerations. In order to make the following Rclone commands work the oCIS administrator needs to enable Basic Authentication e.g. by setting the environment variable PROXY_ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH to true.
Please consider to use Rclone with OpenID Connect instead.
For the usage of a WebDAV remote with Rclone see also the Rclone documentation

      <description>WebDAV with OpenID Connect Rclone itself is not able to open and maintain an OpenID Connect session. But it is able to still use OpenID Connect for authentication by leveraging a so called OIDC-agent.
Setting up the OIDC-agent You need to install the OIDC-agent from your OS&amp;rsquo; package repository (e.g. Debian or MacOS).
Configuring the OIDC-agent Run the following command to add a OpenID Connect profile to your OIDC-agent. It will open the login page of OpenID Connect identity provider where you need to log in if you don&amp;rsquo;t have an active session.</description>

      <description>This section contains information on general topics
GRPC Maximum Message Size ocis is using grpc for inter-service communication. When having a folder with a lot of files (25.000+, the size does not matter) and doing a PROPFIND on that folder, the server will run into errors. This is because the grpc message body becomes to big. With introduction of the envvar OCIS_GRPC_MAX_RECEIVED_MESSAGE_SIZE, the max size for the grpc body can be raised.</description>

      <description>oCIS services often need a port to expose their services to other services or the outside world. As users may have many different extensions running on the same machine, we should track port usage in the oCIS ecosystem. In the best case we ensure that each extension uses a non colliding port range, to make life of users easier.
This page tracks the knowingly used port ranges.
Feel free to &amp;ldquo;reserve&amp;rdquo; a free port range when you&amp;rsquo;re developing an extension by adding your extension to the list (see the edit button in the top right corner).</description>

      <description>TLS Server Certificates By default IDM generates a self-signed certificate and key on first startup to be able to provide TLS protected services. The certificate is stored in idm/ldap.crt inside the oCIS base data directory. The key is in idm/ldap.key in the same directory. You can use a custom server certificate by setting the IDM_LDAPS_CERT and IDM_LDAPS_KEY.
Default / Demo Users On startup IDM creates a set of default services users that are needed internally to provide access to IDM to other oCIS services.</description>

Because of that, it is not possible at the moment to do any kind of easy theming and including custom theme means again compiling custom assets.</description>

      <description>Infinite Scale has implemented OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OIDC defines a discovery mechanism, called OpenID Connect Discovery, where an OpenID server publishes its metadata at a well-known URL, typically:
https://ocis.test/.well-known/openid-configuration
This URL returns a JSON listing of the OpenID/OAuth endpoints, supported scopes and claims, public keys used to sign the tokens, and other details. The clients can use this information to construct a request to the OpenID server. The field names and values are defined in the OpenID Connect Discovery Specification.</description>

      <description>Infinite Scale supports the tus resumable-upload protocol, which is a robust, modular, and open protocol designed to resume large file uploads reliably over HTTP. In situations where file uploads might be interrupted due to network issues, browser crashes, or other unforeseen interruptions, tus ensures that uploads can be resumed from the point of failure without losing data. This documentation shows some basic examples, refer tus official site for more details.</description>

      <description>Status: proposed Deciders: @butonic, @C0rby Date: 2023-01-18 Context and Problem Statement There are three levels of security checks in a microservice web application that uses OpenID Connect:
scope claims limit the possible operations to what the user (or admin on behalf of the organization) consented to service authorization limit the possible operations to what specific services are allowed to do, on behalf of users or even without them permission checks limit the possible operations to the relationships between subject, permission and resource allow This ADR deals with a prerequisite for service authorization: service accounts.</description>

Context and Problem Statement In the early days of the rewrite of ownCloud it was an important goal to keep all important APIs compatible with ownCloud 10. Infinite Scale embraced that goal until version 1.0.0.
After that first release, the focus changed.
Infinite Scale started the spaces feature which brings a whole new set of APIs and concepts.</description>

      <description>Status: accepted Deciders: @butonic, @dschmidt, @micbar, @dragotin Date: 2023-10-17 Context and Problem Statement ownCloud Infinite Scale is supposed to become a data platform and as such it needs to provide access to metadata. Currently only metadata common to all file types (filesize, mime-type, &amp;hellip;) is stored in the index and the metadata storage. We want to make other file type specific metadata available to consumers of our internal and external APIs.</description>

      <description>Releasing ownCloud Web Versioning Release Guide Next steps Releasing ownCloud Web OwnCloud Web can be hosted standalone, as part of oCIS or as ownCloud 10 app (Web UI versions &amp;lt; 7.1.0).
Versioning We follow the Semantic Versioning scheme. Therefore, each change is of one of the possible types: Bugfix, Change, Enhancement, Security.
The highest type before a new release determines the version update number, so if it&amp;rsquo;s only Bugfix and Security changes the next release will be a PATCH version bump, if there&amp;rsquo;s at least one Enhancement within the changes this leads to a MINOR version bump, while Change type changes make for a new MAJOR release version.</description>

      <description>Uploads are handled by a dedicated service that uses TUS.io for resumable uploads. When all bytes have been transferred the upload is finalized by making the file available in file listings and for download.
The finalization may be asynchronous when mandatory workflow steps are involved.

      <description>The spaces concept allows clients to look up the space endpoints a user has access to and then do individual sync discoveries. Technically, we introduce an indirection that allows clients to rely on server provided URLs instead of hardcoded /webdav or /dav/files/{username} paths, that may change over time.

      <description>Development Architecture Implemented Aspects Future work oCIS intends to make the aspects of existing storage systems available as transparently as possible, but the static sync algorithm of the desktop client relies on some form of recursive change time propagation on the server side to detect changes. While this can be bolted on top of existing file systems with inotify, the kernel audit or a fuse based overlay filesystem, a storage system that already implements this aspect is preferable.</description>

      <description>The fallback sync mechanism uses the ETag to determine which part of a sync tree needs to be checked by recursively descending into folders whose ETag has changed. The ETag can be calculated using a stat() call in the filesystem and we are going to explore how many stat() calls are necessary and how the number might be reduced.
ETag propagation What does ETag propagation mean? Whenever a file changes its content or metadata the ETag or &amp;ldquo;entity tag&amp;rdquo; changes.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s not meant to be an extensive list of all tests to be done, rather it should help you, as beta-tester, to get started and enable you to get creative and create your own test-cases. Derive from these examples, be creative, do unusual and unconventional things, to try to break things.</description>

      <description>Introduction In order for an oCIS client to access oCIS storage spaces for an End-User, the client needs to know where the oCIS instance is. oCIS uses WebFinger RFC7033 to locate the oCIS instance for an End-User.
This discovery is optional. If the client has another way of discovering the OpenID instance, e.g. when logging in with a username a static domain might be configured or the domain in the URL might be used.</description>

      <description>oCIS is all about files, sync and share - but most of the time there is more you want to do with your files, e.g. having a different view on your photo collection or editing your offices files in an online file editor. ownCloud 10 faced the same problem and solved it with applications, which can extend the functionality of ownCloud 10 in a wide range. Since oCIS is different in its architecture compared to ownCloud 10, we had to come up with a similar (yet slightly different) solution.</description>

      <description>The migration happens in subsequent stages while the service is online. First all users need to migrate to the new architecture, then the global namespace needs to be introduced. Finally, the data on disk can be migrated user by user by switching the storage driver.
@jfd: It might be easier to introduce the spaces api in oc10 and then migrate to oCIS. We cannot migrate both at the same time, the architecture to oCIS (which will change fileids) and introduce a global namespace (which requires stable fileids to let clients handle moves without redownloading).</description>

      <description>A Settings Bundle is a collection of settings, uniquely identified by the key of the extension registering the bundle and the key of the bundle itself. Its purpose is to let oCIS services define settings and make them available to users. They are dynamically rendered into forms, available in the frontend.
As of now we support five different types of settings:
boolean integer string single choice list of integers or strings multiple choice list of integers or strings Each Setting is uniquely identified by a key within the bundle.</description>

      <description>In order to use the Hello extension we need to configure and start oCIS first. After that we can run the Hello extension itself.
Configure and start oCIS You can either start oCIS from a binary or build it from source.
No matter which way you choose, we need to create a configuration file for ownCloud Web, so that the Hello extension will be loaded in the frontend. Therefore create a file web-config.</description>

      <description>oCIS provides an settings extension that other extensions can use to make settings accessible to users.
In case of the Hello extension administrator users are able to change the greeter message.
Settings are stored and presented to the user by the oCIS settings extension. It also exposes endpoints for registering and manipulating so called settings bundles.
The settings defined through settings bundles can be changed by authenticated users in ownCloud Web, if they have enough permissions to edit them.</description>

      <description>This repository provides a general guideline for creating tests for an oCIS extension. The tests can be written in various levels from unit, integration, and end-to-end. It is not essential to write tests on all these levels as it can be redundant in some cases. This repository provides a reference for all levels of tests.
Unit tests Unit tests generally live inside *_test.go files in the /pkg directory. One such example in this extension is in /pkg/service/v0/service_test.</description>

      <description>A Settings Value is the value an authenticated user has chosen for a specific setting, defined in a settings bundle.
Identifying settings values A settings value is uniquely identified by four attributes. Three of them are coming from the definition of the setting within it&amp;rsquo;s settings bundle (see Settings Bundles for an example). The fourth identifies the user.
extension: Key of the extension that registered the settings bundle, bundleKey: Key of the settings bundle, settingKey: Key of the setting as defined within the bundle, accountUuid: The UUID of the authenticated user who has saved the setting.</description>

      <description>Deprecating Environment Variables Example What happens next? Deprecating Environment Variables Sometimes it is necessary to deprecate environment to align their naming with conventions. We therefore added annotations to automate the documentation process. It is necessary to know when the variable is going to be deprecated, when it is going to be removed and why.
Example // Notifications defines the config options for the notifications service. type Notifications struct { RevaGateway string `yaml:&amp;#34;reva_gateway&amp;#34; env:&amp;#34;OCIS_REVA_GATEWAY;REVA_GATEWAY&amp;#34; desc:&amp;#34;CS3 gateway used to look up user metadata&amp;#34; deprecationVersion:&amp;#34;3.</description>

      <description>You may have asked yourself why there are major version 1 tags in our GitHub repository but the Readme still states ownCloud Infinite Scale is currently in a technical preview state. It will be subject to a lot of changes and is not yet ready for general production deployments.. How can that be if it&amp;rsquo;s a major version 1?
Our initial and also our current plan is to stick to SemVer as versioning scheme.</description>
