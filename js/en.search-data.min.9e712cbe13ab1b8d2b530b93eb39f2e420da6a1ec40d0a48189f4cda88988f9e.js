Location of the file can be provided via a prop called configLocation. This requires full URL address (e.g. https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;path-to-the-config\u0026gt;). If the prop is not defined, the location will fallback to https://\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/file-picker-config.json. The config can point to both oauth2 and OIDC. You can take a look at the following example to see how OIDC can be defined:\n{ \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;owncloud-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;openIdConnect\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;metadata_url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;/.well-known/openid-configuration\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;your-server\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;client_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;client-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;response_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;openid profile email\u0026#34; }, } Install File picker package To integrate File picker into your own product, you can install it via one of the following commands:\nnpm install @ownclouders/file-picker --save # OR yarn add @ownclouders/file-picker Integrate in HTML page with vanilla JavaScript When including File picker in an HTML page, it is important to include Vue.js as well. In this case, we will import it via unpkg. Without this, the component won\u0026rsquo;t work. Vue needs to be included also if you\u0026rsquo;re importing the File picker into a web application built with other framework than Vue (e.g. React, Angular).\nFor the purpose of this example, we will assume that you do not move installed packages and include the folder \u0026ldquo;node_modules\u0026rdquo; with installed packages in the same location as your index.html file on your server.\n... \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;File picker example\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://unpkg.com/vue\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;./node_modules/file-picker/dist/file-picker.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;file-picker id=\u0026#34;file-picker\u0026#34; variation=\u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/file-picker\u0026gt; Integrate in Vue web application There is a caveat when using the File picker inside an existing Vue application. Since the web component will be imported before Vue, we need to define it as a global variable on our own. This requires us to separate the import of Vue into a bootstrap file.\nvue.js:\nimport Vue from \u0026#39;vue\u0026#39; window.Vue = Vue main.js:\nimport Vue from \u0026#39;./vue\u0026#39; new Vue(...)

To define which one should be used, you need to pass it to the component via its variation property. Valid values are:\n resource - File picker location - Location picker  "});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/integration/file_picker/accessing-resources/','title':"Accessing Resources",'content':"    Access resources     File picker is returning selected resources via event called selectResources.

The settings frontend can be plugged into ocis-web, showing forms for changing settings values as a user. The forms are generated from the registered settings bundles.  Settings usage:\n Extensions can query ocis-settings for settings values of a user. The ownCloud SDK, used as a data abstraction layer for ocis-web, will query ocis-settings for settings values of a user, if it\u0026rsquo;s available. The SDK uses sensible defaults when ocis-settings is not part of the setup.

You could miss updates on this file. Run make clean to delete the file and keep the development environment tidy otherwise as well.  Add your hostname to the idp config Let us assume your-host is your remote domain name or IP adress.

An LDAP Bind you may ask? Read on!\n Start ocis-glauth We are going to use the above ownCloud 10 and graphapi app to turn it into the datastore for an LDAP proxy.\nGrab it! In an ocis folder\n$ git clone git@github.com:owncloud/ocis-glauth.git $ cd ocis-glauth $ make This should give you a bin/ocis-glauth binary. Try listing the help with bin/ocis-glauth --help.\nRun it! You need to point ocis-glauth to your owncloud domain:\n$ bin/ocis-glauth --log-level debug server --backend-datastore owncloud --backend-server https://cloud.example.com --backend-basedn dc=example,dc=com --log-level debug is only used to generate more verbose output --backend-datastore owncloud switches to tho owncloud datastore --backend-server https://cloud.example.com is the url to an ownCloud instance with an enabled graphapi app --backend-basedn dc=example,dc=com is used to construct the LDAP dn. The user admin will become cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com.\nCheck it is up and running You should now be able to list accounts from your ownCloud 10 oc_accounts table using:\n$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9125 -b dc=example,dc=com -D \u0026#34;cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\u0026#34; -W \u0026#39;(objectclass=posixaccount)\u0026#39; Groups should work as well:\n$ ldapsearch -x -H ldap://localhost:9125 -b dc=example,dc=com -D \u0026#34;cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\u0026#34; -W \u0026#39;(objectclass=posixgroup)\u0026#39;  Note: This is currently a readonly implementation and minimal to the usecase of authenticating users with konnectd.\n Start ocis-phoenix Get it!

Try listing the help with bin/ocis-phoenix --help.\nRun it! Point ocis-phoenix to your owncloud domain and tell it where to find the openid connect issuing authority:\n$ bin/ocis-phoenix server --web-config-server https://cloud.example.com --oidc-authority https://192.168.1.100:9130 --oidc-metadata-url https://192.168.1.100:9130/.well-known/openid-configuration --oidc-client-id ocis ocis-phoenix needs to know\n --web-config-server https://cloud.example.com is ownCloud url with webdav and ocs endpoints (oc10 or ocis) --oidc-authority https://192.168.1.100:9130 the openid connect issuing authority, in our case oidc-konnectd, running on port 9130 --oidc-metadata-url https://192.168.1.100:9130/.well-known/openid-configuration the openid connect configuration endpoint, typically the issuer host with .well-known/openid-configuration, but there are cases when another endpoint is used, eg. ping identity provides multiple endpoints to separate domains --oidc-client-id ocis the client id we will register later with ocis-konnectd in the identifier-registration.yaml  Start ocis-konnectd Get it! In an ocis folder\n$ git clone git@github.com:owncloud/ocis-konnectd.git $ cd ocis-konnectd $ make This should give you a bin/ocis-konnectd binary. Try listing the help with bin/ocis-konnectd --help.\nSet environment variables Konnectd needs environment variables to configure the LDAP server:\nexport LDAP_URI=ldap://192.168.1.100:9125 export LDAP_BINDDN=\u0026#34;cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\u0026#34; export LDAP_BINDPW=\u0026#34;its-a-secret\u0026#34; export LDAP_BASEDN=\u0026#34;dc=example,dc=com\u0026#34; export LDAP_SCOPE=sub export LDAP_LOGIN_ATTRIBUTE=uid export LDAP_EMAIL_ATTRIBUTE=mail export LDAP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE=givenName export LDAP_UUID_ATTRIBUTE=uid export LDAP_UUID_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE=text export LDAP_FILTER=\u0026#34;(objectClass=posixaccount)\u0026#34; Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use an existing user and the correct password.\nConfigure clients Now we need to configure a client we can later use to configure the ownCloud 10 openidconnect app. In the assets/identifier-registration.yaml have:\n---# OpenID Connect client registry.clients:- id:ocisname:ownCloudInfiniteScaleinsecure:yesapplication_type:webredirect_uris:- https://cloud.example.com/apps/openidconnect/redirect- http://localhost:9100/oidc-callback.html- http://localhost:9100- http://localhost:9100/You will need the insecure: yes if you are using self signed certificates.\nReplace cloud.example.com in the redirect URI with your ownCloud 10 host and port. Replace localhost:9100 in the redirect URIs with your the ocis-phoenix host and port.\nRun it! You can now bring up ocis-connectd with:\n$ bin/ocis-konnectd server --iss https://192.168.1.100:9130 --identifier-registration-conf assets/identifier-registration.yaml --signing-kid gen1-2020-02-27 ocis-konnectd needs to know\n --iss https://192.168.1.100:9130 the issuer, which must be a reachable https endpoint. For testing an ip works. HTTPS is NOT optional. This url is exposed in the https://192.168.1.100:9130/.well-known/openid-configuration endpoint and clients need to be able to connect to it --identifier-registration-conf assets/identifier-registration.yaml the identifier-registration.yaml you created --signing-kid gen1-2020-02-27 a signature key id, otherwise the jwks key has no name, which might cause problems with clients. a random key is ok, but it should change when the actual signing key changes.  Check it is up and running  Try getting the configuration:  $ curl https://192.168.1.100:9130/.well-known/openid-configuration Check if the login works at https://192.168.1.100:9130/signin/v1/identifier   Note: If you later get a Unable to find a key for (algorithm, kid):PS256, ) Error make sure you did set a --signing-kid when starting ocis-konnectd by checking it is present in https://192.168.1.100:9130/konnect/v1/jwks.json\n Patch owncloud While the UserSession in ownCloud 10 is currently used to test all available IAuthModule implementations, it immediately logs out the user when an exception occurs. However, existing owncloud 10 instances use the oauth2 app to create Bearer tokens for mobile and desktop clients.\nTo give the openidconnect app a chance to verify the tokens we need to change the code a bit. See https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/37043 for a possible solution.\n Note: The PR is hot \u0026hellip; as in younger than this list of steps. And it messes with authentication. Use with caution.\n Install the owncloud 10 openidconnect app In an owncloud 10 apps folder\n$ git clone git@github.com:owncloud/openidconnect.git $ cd openidconnect $ composer install After enabling the app configure it in config/oidc.config.php\n$CONFIG = [ \u0026#39;openid-connect\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;provider-url\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;https://192.168.1.100:9130\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;client-id\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;ocis\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;loginButtonName\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;OpenId Connect @ Konnectd\u0026#39;, ], \u0026#39;debug\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, // if using self signed certificates // allow the different domains access to the ocs and wabdav endpoints: \u0026#39;cors.allowed-domains\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;https://cloud.example.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;http://localhost:9100\u0026#39;, ], ]; In the above configuration replace\n provider-url with the URL to your ocis-konnectd issuer https://cloud.example.com with the URL to your ownCloud 10 instance http://localhost:9100 with the URL to your phoenix instance   Note: By default the openidconnect app will use the email of the user to match the user from the oidc userinfo endpoint with the ownCloud account. So make sure your users have a unique primary email.\n Next steps Aside from the above todos these are the next stepo\n tie it all together behind ocis-proxy create an ocis bridge command that runs all the ocis services in one step with a properly preconfigured ocis-konnectd identifier-registration.yaml file for phoenix and the owncloud 10 openidconnect app, as well as a randomized --signing-kid.

Home data provider   Verification Further exploration Cleaning up Troubleshooting  Docker-compose exits right away Where are the logs ? How do I update a service in the ocis container? Creation and upload of files does not work Uploading big files appears to hang Running out of space quickly       OCIS can be configured to run on top of eos. While the eos documentation does cover a lot of topics it leaves out some details that you may have to either pull from various docker containers, the forums or even the source itself.\nThis document is a work in progress of the current setup.\nDocker dev environment for eos storage We begin with the docker-compose.yml found in https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/ and switch it to eos-storage.\n1. Start eos \u0026amp; ocis containers Start the eos cluster and ocis via the compose stack.\ndocker-compose up -d The first time the ocis container starts up, it will compile ocis from scratch which can take a while. To follow progress, run docker-compose logs -f --tail=10 ocis  2. LDAP support Configure the OS to resolve users and groups using ldap\ndocker-compose exec -d ocis /start-ldap Check that the OS in the ocis container can now resolve einstein or the other demo users\n$ docker-compose exec ocis id einstein uid=20000(einstein) gid=30000(users) groups=30000(users),30001(sailing-lovers),30002(violin-haters),30007(physics-lovers) If the user is not found at first you might need to wait a few more minutes in case the ocis container is still compiling.

Then delete the local \u0026ldquo;bin\u0026rdquo; folder as root which contains the ocis binaries compiled by the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; docker.\nTroubleshooting Docker-compose exits right away When running docker-compose up -d ocis exits right away.\nYou can check the error code using docker-compose ps and investigate further by running only ocis again using docker-compose up ocis (without -d so you can see what is going on in the foreground). One reason might be that the binary was already built but does not match the container env. Try running make clean before running docker-compose up ocis so it gets built inside the container.\nWhere are the logs ? The ocis logs can be accessed using docker-compose logs ocis. Add -f for following.\nHow do I update a service in the ocis container?  docker-compose exec ocis make clean build to update the binary docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis kill \u0026lt;service\u0026gt; to kill the service docker-compose exec ocis ./bin/ocis run \u0026lt;service\u0026gt; to start the service. Do not forget to set any env vars, eg. docker-compose exec -e REVA_STORAGE_EOS_LAYOUT=\u0026quot;{{substr 0 1 .Id.OpaqueId}}/{{.Id.OpaqueId}}\u0026quot; -e REVA_STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eoshome ocis ./bin/ocis run reva-storage-home  Creation and upload of files does not work If the upload did not work, please check the status of the eos space using the command docker-compose exec mgm-master eos fs ls. In case the default space appears as offline, run docker-compose exec mgm-master eos space set default on.\nUploading big files appears to hang Please note that the uploads first go into the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; docker and land in its \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; folder, then gets copied over to the EOS docker using xrdcopy. This is why uploading first transfers all bytes and then seem to hang for a while during the final copy.\nRunning out of space quickly The EOS dockers are configured with replication, so every file uploaded there will be replicated 4 times, so make sure there is enough physical space on disk when testing.\nAlso please note that older failed uploads might still be present in the \u0026ldquo;/tmp\u0026rdquo; directory of the \u0026ldquo;ocis\u0026rdquo; container.\n"});index.add({'id':45,'href':'/extensions/konnectd/building/','title':"Building",'content':"    Backend     As this project is built with Go, so you need to install that first.

While you could rerun storage storage-oc multiple times with different flags to get multiple instances we are giving the different commands the necessary default configuration to allow the ocis binary to simply start them and not deal with configuration.\nStorage providers To manage the file tree ocis uses storage storage providers that are accessing the underlying storage using a storage driver. The driver can be used to change the implementation of a storage aspect to better reflect the actual underlying storage capabilities. As an example a move operation on a POSIX filesystem (theoretically) is an atomic operation. When trying to implement a file tree on top of S3 there is no native move operation that can be used. A naive implementation might fall back on a COPY and DELETE. Some S3 implementations provide a COPY operation that uses an existing key as the source, so the file at least does not need to be reuploaded. In the worst case scenario, which is renaming a folder with hundreds of thousands of objects, a reupload for every file has to be made. Instead of hiding this complexity a better choice might be to disable renaming of files or at least folders on S3. There are however implementations of filesystems on top of S3 that store the tree metadata in dedicated objects or use a completely different persistence mechanism like a distributed key value store to implement the file tree aspect of a storage.\nWhile the storage provider is responsible for managing the tree, file up and download is delegated to a dedicated data provider. See below.  Storage aspects A lot of different storage technologies exist, ranging from general purpose file systems with POSIX semantics to software defined storage with multiple APIs. Choosing any of them is making a tradeoff decision. Or, if a storage technology is already in place it automatically predetermines the capabilities that can be made available. Not all storage systems are created equal.\nUnfortunately, no POSIX filesystem natively supports all storage aspects that ownCloud 10 requires:\nA hierarchical file tree An important aspect of a filesystem is organizing files and directories in a file hierarchy, or tree. It allows you to create, move and delete nodes. Beside the name a node also has well known metadata like size and mtime that are persisted in the tree as well.\nFolders are not directories There is a difference between folder and directory: a directory is a file system concept. A folder is a metaphor for the concept of a physical file folder. There are also virtual folders or smart folders like the recent files folder which are no file system directories. So, every directory and every virtual folder is a folder, but not every folder is a directory. See the folder metaphor in wikipedia. Also see the activity history below.  Id based lookup While traditionally nodes in the tree are reached by traversing the path the tree persistence should be prepared to look up a node by an id. Think of an inode in a POSIX filesystem. If this operation needs to be cached for performance reasons keep in mind that cache invalidation is hard and crawling all files to update the inode to path mapping takes O(n), not O(1).\nETag propagation For the state based sync a client can discover changes by recursively descending the tree and comparing the ETag for every node. If the storage technology supports propagating ETag changes up the tree, only the root node of a tree needs to be checked to determine if a discovery needs to be started and which nodes need to be traversed. This allows using the storage technology itself to persist all metadata that is necessary for sync, without additional services or caches.\nSubtree size accounting The tree can keep track of how many bytes are stored in a folder. Similar to ETag propagation a change in file size is propagated up the hierarchy.\nETag and Size propagation When propagating the ETag (mtime) and size changes up the tree the question is where to stop. If all changes need to be propagated to the root of a storage then the root or busy folders will become a hotspot. There are two things to keep in mind: 1. propagation only happens up to the root of a single space (a user private drive or a single group drive), 2. no cross storage propagation. The latter was used in oc10 to let clients detect when a file in a received shared folder changed. This functionality is moving to the storage registry which caches the ETag for every root so clients can discover if and which storage changed.  Rename Depending on the underlying storage technology some operations may either be slow, up to a point where it makes more sense to disable them entirely. One example is a folder rename: on S3 a simple folder rename translates to a copy and delete operation for every child of the renamed folder. There is an exception though: this restriction only applies if the S3 storage is treated like a filesystem, where the keys are the path and the value is the file content. There are smarter ways to implement file systems on top of S3, but again: there is always a tradeoff.\nS3 has no rename Technically, S3 has no rename operation at all. By design, the location of the value is determined by the key, so it always has to do a copy and delete. Another example is the redis RENAME operation: while being specified as O(1) it executes an implicit DEL operation, so if the deleted key contains a very big value it may cause high latency\u0026hellip;  Arbitrary metadata persistence In addition to well known metadata like name size and mtime, users might be able to add arbitrary metadata like tags, comments or dublin core. In POSIX filesystems this maps to extended attributes.\nGrant persistence The CS3 API uses grants to describe access permissions. Storage systems have a wide range of permissions granularity and not all grants may be supported by every storage driver. POSIX ACLs for example have no expiry. If the storage system does not support certain grant properties, e.g. expiry, then the storage driver may choose to implement them in a different way. Expiries could be persisted in a different way and checked periodically to remove the grants. Again: every decision is a tradeoff.\nTrash persistence After deleting a node the storage allows listing the deleted nodes and has an undo mechanism for them.\nVersions persistence A user can restore a previous version of a file.\nSnapshots are not versions Modern POSIX filesystems support snapshotting of volumes. This is different from keeping track of versions to a file or folder, but might be another implementation strategy for a storage driver to allow users to restore content.  Activity History The storage keeps an activity history, tracking the different actions that have been performed. This does not only include file changes but also metadata changes like renames and permission changes.\nStorage drivers Reva currently has four storage driver implementations that can be used for storage providers an well as data providers.\nLocal Storage Driver The minimal storage driver for a POSIX based filesystem. It literally supports none of the storage aspect other than basic file tree management. Sharing can - to a degree - be implemented using POSIX ACLs.\n tree provided by a POSIX filesystem  inefficient path by id lookup, currently uses the file path as id, so ids are not stable  can store a uuid in extended attributes and use a cache to look them up, similar to the ownCloud driver   no native ETag propagation, five options are available:  built in propagation (changes bypassing ocis are not picked up until a rescan) built in inotify (requires 48 bytes of RAM per file, needs to keep track of every file and folder) external inotify (same RAM requirement, but could be triggered by external tools, e.g. a workflow engine) kernel audit log (use the linux kernel audit to capture file events on the storage and offload them to a queue) fuse filesystem overlay   no subtree accounting, same options as for ETag propagation efficient rename arbitrary metadata using extended attributes   grant persistence  using POSIX ACLs  requires an LDAP server to make guest accounts available in the OS  OCIS has glauth which contains all users an existing LDAP could be used if guests ar provisioned in another way     using extended attributes to implement expiry or sharing that does not require OS level integration fuse filesystem overlay   no native trash  could use the The FreeDesktop.org Trash specification fuse filesystem overlay   no native versions, multiple options possible  git for folders rcs for single files rsnapshot for hourly / daily / weekly / monthly backups \u0026hellip; but this is not versioning as known from oc10 design new freedesktop spec, basically what is done in oc10 without the limitations or borrow ideas from the freedesktop trash spec fuse filesystem overlay    To provide the other storage aspects we plan to implement a FUSE overlay filesystem which will add the different aspects on top of local filesystems like ext4, btrfs or xfs. It should work on NFSv45 as well, although NFSv4 supports RichACLs and we will explore how to leverage them to implement sharing at a future date. The idea is to use the storages native capabilities to deliver the best user experience. But again: that means making the right tradeoffs.\nOwnCloud Storage Driver This is the current default storage driver. While it implements the file tree (using redis, including id based lookup), ETag propagation, trash, versions and sharing (including expiry) using the data directory layout of ownCloud 10 it has known limitations that cannot be fixed without changing the actual layout on disk.\nTo setup it up properly in a distributed fashion, the storage-home and the storage-oc need to share the same underlying FS. Their \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; counterparts also need access to the same shared FS. For a simple docker-compose setup, you can create a volume which will be used by the \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-home\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-home-data\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-oc\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;storage-storage-oc-data\u0026rdquo; containers. Using the owncloud/ocis docker image, the volume would need to be hooked in the /var/tmp/ocis folder insde the containers.\n tree provided by a POSIX filesystem  file layout is mapped to the old ownCloud 10 layout  the root of tree for a user on disk is prefixed with /path/to/data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/files/   efficient path by id lookup  all files and folders get assigned a uuid in the extended attributes when starting the storage provider it will walk all files to populate a redis kv store for uuid to path lookup slow to boot trees with lots of nodes   build in ETag propagation  ETags are calculated based on mtime mtime is propagated by the storage driver changes bypassing ocis are not picked up until a restart of the storage provider   no subtree accounting, same options as for local storage efficient rename  TODO update the kv store for path lookup, this is an O(n) operation   arbitrary metadata using extended attributes   grant persistence  using custom ACLs that are stored as extended attributes  a grant corresponds to one extended attribute of 40-100 bytes, effectively limiting the number of shares to ~100-40 extended attributes have varying limitations, based on the underlying filesystem  the linux kernel imposes a limit of 255bytes per name and 64KiB per value ext2/3/4: total bytes for all attributes of a file is limited to 4KiB (a filesystem block) xfs: limit of 64KiB per value btrfs: total bytes used for the name, value, and implementation overhead bytes 16KiB (the default filesystem nodesize value)     does not require OS level integration   built in trash  trashed files are moved to /path/to/data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/files_trashbin/ trashed files are appended a timestamp .d\u0026lt;unixtime\u0026gt;, which breaks trashing of files that reach the filesystems specific name limit   built in versions  file versions are stored in /path/to/data/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/files_versions/ file versions are appended a timestamp .d\u0026lt;unixtime\u0026gt;, which breaks versioning of files that reach the filesystems specific name limit    EOS Storage Driver The CERN eos storage has evolved with ownCloud and natively supports id based lookup, ETag propagation, subtree size accounting, sharing, trash and versions. To use it you need to change the default configuration of the storage storage-home command (or have a look at the Makefile ̀ eos-start` target):\nexport STORAGE_STORAGE_HOME_DRIVER=eos export STORAGE_STORAGE_EOS_NAMESPACE=/eos export STORAGE_STORAGE_EOS_MASTER_URL=\u0026#34;root://eos-mgm1.eoscluster.cern.ch:1094\u0026#34; export STORAGE_STORAGE_EOS_ENABLE_HOME=true export STORAGE_STORAGE_EOS_LAYOUT=\u0026#34;dockertest/{{.Username}}\u0026#34; Running it locally also requires the eos and xrootd binaries. Running it using make eos-start will use CentOS based containers that already have the necessary packages installed.\nPull requests to add explicit storage storage-(s3|custom|...) commands with working defaults are welcome.  S3 Storage Driver A naive driver that treats the keys in an S3 capable storage as / delimited path names. While it does not support MOVE or ETag propagation it can be used to read and write files. Better integration with native capabilities like versioning is possible but depends on the Use Case. Several storage solutions that provide an S3 interface also support some form of notifications that can be used to implement ETag propagation.\nData Providers Clients using the CS3 API use an InitiateFileDownload and ]InitiateUpload](https://cs3org.github.io/cs3apis/#cs3.storage.provider.v1beta1.InitiateFileUploadRequest) request at the storage gateway to obtain a URL endpoint that can be used to either GET the file content or upload content using the resumable tus.io protocol.\nThe data provider uses the same storage driver as the storage provider but can be scaled independently.\nThe dataprovider allows uploading the file to a quarantine area where further data analysis may happen before making the file accessible again. One use case for this is anti virus scanning for files coming from untrusted sources.\nFuture work FUSE overlay filesystem We are planning to further separate the concerns and use a local storage provider with a FUSE filesystem overlaying the actual POSIX storage that can be used to capture deletes and writes that might happen outside of ocis/reva.\nIt would allow us to extend the local storage driver with missing storage aspects while keeping a tree like filesystem that end users are used to see when sshing into the machine.\nUpload to Quarantine area Antivirus scanning of random files uploaded from untrusted sources and executing metadata extraction or thumbnail generation should happen in a sandboxed system to prevent malicious users from gaining any information about the system. By spawning a new container with access to only the uploaded data we can further limit the attack surface.\n"});index.add({'id':58,'href':'/extensions/storage/testing/','title':"Testing",'content':"API Acceptance tests We are using the ownCloud 10 API acceptance testsuite against ocis.

Every scenario that does not work in OCIS with OC storage, is listed in tests/acceptance/expected-failures-on-OC-storage.txt with a link to the related issue. Similarly, scenarios that do not work in OCIS with EOS storage are listed in tests/acceptance/expected-failures-on-EOS-storage.txt. Scenarios from the oC10 API acceptance tests are run in the ordinary acceptance test pipeline in CI. The scenarios that fail are checked against the expected failures. If there are any differences then the CI pipeline fails.\nAdditionally, some issues have scenarios that demonstrate the current buggy behaviour in ocis(reva). Those scenarios are in this ocis-reva repository in tests/acceptance/features/apiOcisSpecific. Have a look into the documentation to understand why we are writing those tests. Also, ocis behaves partly differently with EOS-Storage and OC-Storage. There are scenarios that do not work in OCIS when run on EOS-storage, but works when on OC-Storage, and vice-versa. For those kind of scenarios,  @skipOnOcis-EOS-Storage and @skipOnOcis-OC-Storage tags are used. For instance, for a scenario that fails on EOS-Storage but passes on OC-Storage, we use @skipOnOcis-EOS-Storage tag to let it run on OC-Storage, where it works as expected, instead of skipping the test completely.\nIf you want to work on a specific issue\n  adjust the core commit id to the latest commit in core so that CI will run the latest test code and scenarios from core. For that change coreCommit in the config section:\nconfig = { 'apiTests': { 'coreBranch': 'master', 'coreCommit': 'a06b1bd5ba8e5244bfaf7fa04f441961e6fb0daa', 'numberOfParts': 2 } }    locally run each of the tests marked with that issue in the expected failures file:\nE.g.:\nmake test-acceptance-api \\ TEST_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:9140 \\ TEST_EXTERNAL_USER_BACKENDS=true \\ TEST_OCIS=true \\ OCIS_REVA_DATA_ROOT=/var/tmp/reva/ \\ BEHAT_FEATURE=\u0026#39;tests/acceptance/features/apiComments/comments.feature:123\u0026#39;   the tests will fail, try to understand how and why they are failing\n  fix the code\n  go back to 2. and repeat till the tests are passing.\n  remove those tests from the expected failures file.\n  run each of the local tests that were demonstrating the buggy behavior. They should fail.\n  delete each of the local tests that were demonstrating the buggy behavior.\n  make a PR that has the fixed code, relevant lines removed from the expected failures file and bug demonstration tests deleted.\nIf the changes also affect the ocis repository make sure the changes get ported over there. That will need the fixed code in storage to be applied to ocis along with the test-related changes.\n  Notes  in a normal case the test-code cleans up users after the test-run, but if a test-run is interrupted (e.g. by CTRL+C) users might have been left on the LDAP server. In that case rerunning the tests requires wiping the users in the ldap server, otherwise the tests will fail when trying to populate the users. This can be done by simply running docker stop docker-slapd \u0026amp;\u0026amp; docker rm docker-slapd and restarting the LDAP server container the tests usually create users in the OU TestUsers with usernames specified in the feature file. If not defined in the feature file, most users have the password 123456, defined by regularUserPassword in behat.yml, but other passwords are also used, see \\FeatureContext::getPasswordForUser() for mapping and \\FeatureContext::__construct for the password definitions.

To set this up you need the owncloud 10 core repo, a ldap server that the acceptance tests can use to manage users, a redis server for file-versions and the ocis code.\nGetting the tests All you need to do to get the acceptance tests is check out the core repo:\ngit clone https://github.com/owncloud/core.git Run a redis server in a docker container File versions need a redis server.

Every scenario that does not work in OCIS with OC storage, is listed in tests/acceptance/expected-failures-on-OC-storage.txt with a link to the related issue.\nThose scenarios are run in the ordinary acceptance test pipeline in CI. The scenarios that fail are checked against the expected failures. If there are any differences then the CI pipeline fails. Similarly, scenarios that do not work in OCIS with EOS storage are listed in tests/acceptance/expected-failures-on-EOS-storage.txt.

But how do apps actually talk to the server?\nShort answer: any way you like\nLong answer: micro and ocis-hello follow a protocol driven development:\n  specify the API using protobuf\n  generate client and server code\n  evolve based on the protocol\n  CS3 api uses protobuf as well and uses GRPC\n  ocis uses go-micro, which provides http and grpc gateways\n  the gateways and protocols are optional\n  owncloud and kopano are looking into a MS graph like api to handle phoenix requests.\n they might be about user, contacrs, calendars \u0026hellip; which is covered by the graph api we want to integrate with eg. kopano and provide a commen api (file sync and share is covered as well)    as an example for protobuf take a look at ocis-hello\n  "});index.add({'id':62,'href':'/extensions/glauth/license/','title':"License",'content':"This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

Unfortunately, this hides the actual source of the error. We could set a breakpoint in line 94 and reproduce the problem, which can be a lot harder than just clicking the share button or sending a curl request again. So let us see what else the log tells us.\nThe previous line tells us that a Stat request failed: uri=/cs3.gateway.v1beta1.GatewayAPI/Stat. This time the line is written by the grpc log interceptor. What else is there?\nThe first line tells us that looking up the responsible storage provider seems to have succeeded: uri=/cs3.storage.registry.v1beta1.RegistryAPI/GetStorageProvider.\nAt this point it your familiarity with the codebase starts to become a factor.

This gives control to every service to define settings that are needed for fulfilling it\u0026rsquo;s intended purpose. There are different types of settings available out of the box - hopefully those already fit your needs. The settings defined through settings bundles can be changed by authenticated users through an ocis-web extension, which is also provided by the settings service. As a result, your service only has to register a settings bundle and oCIS takes care of everything else. Your service can simply use the settings values that were set by users.\nWith this chapter we want to show you, how to register a settings bundle and how to use the respective values that were set by users. We do this by customizing the greeter phrase from our greeter service in ocis-hello.\nYou can find the source code, especially how it\u0026rsquo;s integrated into the service, in the following files:\n pkg/service/v0/service.go for the requests, pkg/command/server.go for the integration of RegisterSettingsBundles into the service start.  Register settings bundle In order to register a settings bundle, you need to create a request message and then send it to the BundleService of ocis-settings through a gRPC call.\nCreate request request := \u0026amp;settings.SaveSettingsBundleRequest{ SettingsBundle: \u0026amp;settings.SettingsBundle{ Identifier: \u0026amp;settings.Identifier{ Extension: \u0026#34;ocis-hello\u0026#34;, BundleKey: \u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;, }, DisplayName: \u0026#34;Greeting\u0026#34;, Settings: []*settings.Setting{ { SettingKey: \u0026#34;phrase\u0026#34;, DisplayName: \u0026#34;Phrase\u0026#34;, Description: \u0026#34;Phrase for replies on the greet request\u0026#34;, Value: \u0026amp;settings.Setting_StringValue{ StringValue: \u0026amp;settings.StringSetting{ Required: true, Default: \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;, MaxLength: 15, }, }, }, }, }, } The request holds only one field, which is a SettingsBundle. It consists of an Identifier, a DisplayName and a list of Settings.\n The Extension and BundleKey inside the Identifier are required and have to be alphanumeric (- and _ are allowed as well). The Identifier has to stay stable - if you change it, existing settings will not be migrated to the new identifier. The DisplayName is required and may contain any UTF8 character. It will be shown in the settings user frontend in a generated form, so please try to be descriptive. You can change the DisplayName at any time. Settings is the list of settings you want to make available with this settings bundle. In this example, there is only one setting defined - a string setting for the phrase our greeter uses in the response. You can explore more types of settings in the settings package. All of them come with their own characteristics and validations. For the phrase setting we decided to set it to Required, so that it can\u0026rsquo;t be empty, and to set a MaxLength of 15 characters, so that the phrase is not too long. The SettingKey is particularly important, as this is used for referencing the setting in other requests. It has to fulfill the same rules as the other Identifier attributes. Please also take the time to set a Description, in order to provide accessibility in the generated forms as good as possible.  Send request to ocis-settings This request message can be sent to the BundleService of ocis-settings like this:\nbundleService := settings.NewBundleService(\u0026#34;com.owncloud.api.settings\u0026#34;, mclient.DefaultClient) response, err := bundleService.SaveSettingsBundle(context.Background(), request) We run this request on every start of ocis-hello so that the settings service always has the most recent version of the settings bundle.\nUse settings value We registered the greeter phrase setting for a reason: We want to allow the authenticated user to customize how they want to be greeted by ocis-hello. In order to do this, we need to ask ocis-settings on every request, what the greeter phrase of the authenticated user is.\nAccount UUID The settings request has one important prerequisite: As our service is stateless, we need to know the account UUID of the authenticated user the incoming POST request to our greeter service is coming from. As that POST request is coming through ocis-proxy, there is an HTTP header x-access-token that holds a JWT with the account UUID in it. We just have to dismantle the JWT to get the UUID. There is a middleware for that in ocis-pkg. You can look up the server configuration for that middleware in pkg/server/http/server.go. In essence, it dismantles the x-access-token, extracts the account UUID and makes it available in the context. It can be subsequently retrieved from the context like this:\nownAccountUUID := ctx.Value(middleware.UUIDKey).(string) Create request With the account UUID we can build an Identifier for the request to ocis-settings as follows:\nrequest := \u0026amp;settings.GetSettingsValueRequest{ Identifier: \u0026amp;settings.Identifier{ Extension: \u0026#34;ocis-hello\u0026#34;, BundleKey: \u0026#34;greeting\u0026#34;, SettingKey: \u0026#34;phrase\u0026#34;, AccountUuid: ownAccountUUID, }, } The Identifier for getting a value from ocis-settings needs the three fields for extension, bundle and setting that we chose in the settings bundle. The fourth field is the UUID of the authenticated user.\nSend request to ocis-settings This request message can be sent to the ValueService of ocis-settings like this:\nvalueService := settings.NewValueService(\u0026#34;com.owncloud.api.settings\u0026#34;, mclient.DefaultClient) response, err := valueService.GetSettingsValue(ctx, request) If this request is successful we will have a - possibly customized - greeting phrase. It could also be the default value, if the user didn\u0026rsquo;t customize their phrase in the settings frontend.\nConclusion You have learned how to register settings bundles, how to get the account UUID of the authenticated user and how to query the settings service for settings values.\n"});index.add({'id':79,'href':'/extensions/ocis_hello/testing/','title':"Testing",'content':"This repository provides a general guideline for creating tests for the ocis extensions. The tests can be written in various levels from unit, integration, and end-to-end. It is not essential to write tests on all these levels as it can be redundant in some cases. This repository provides a reference for all levels of tests.\nUnit tests Unit tests generally live inside *_test.go files in the /pkg directory. One such example in this extension is in /pkg/service/v0/service_test.go. Similarly the unit test for the protobuf generated code can also be written just like in /pkg/proto/hello.pb_test.go.\nIntegration tests There are mainly 2 types of integration tests, namely HTTP tests, and GRPC tests. These tests mostly live in /pkg/proto directory where all the protobuf definitions are specified. The examples for the HTTP integration tests are in /pkg/proto/hello.pb.web_test.go whereas the GRPC tests are in /pkg/proto/hello.pb.micro_test.go.\nEnd-to-End tests For extensions with an UI, we can also write end-to-end tests using the Nightwatch test framework. These tests live in /ui/tests directory. We can reuse already existing Gherkin steps from the phoenix tests here.\nRunning the tests Unit and integration tests The unit and integration tests are run using the simple go test command. If you wish to run all the tests with the coverage you can just use make command.\nmake test You can also run a specific file with the go test command\ngo test \u0026lt;path to package or file\u0026gt; End-to-End tests Running end-to-end tests is a bit more complicated than unit and integration tests. First of all we will need a complete ocis setup with ocis-hello running. For that refer to this guide.\nAfter that, We need to set the proper test environment. To run the end-to-end tests, first-of-all we need the phoenix repository where all the test infrastructure exists. So, clone the phoenix repository in your system in any location.\ngit clone https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix $HOME/phoenix Next we will need to start the selenium server which will control the browser. There is a script in the phoenix repo that starts the selenium server, just run that to start selenium.\ncd $HOME/phoenix yarn run selenium Now we can run the tests. The tests will take several configuration variables which can be found here. Without configuration, most of the defaults will work. We just need make sure to set these values through env variable.\nexport PHOENIX_PATH=$HOME/phoenix export OCIS_SKELETON_DIR=\u0026lt;path to the skeleton directory\u0026gt; export PHOENIX_CONFIG=\u0026lt;path to the config.json file used by phoenix\u0026gt; The phoenix path should be set to the directory where the phoenix source files are. Our tests use the existing infrastructure from the phoenix directory to run the tests.\nThe skeleton directory for the webui tests can be found in the testing app. You can just clone that repository in your local machine and point the env variable to the correct path.\nWhile running ocis we should always use a config file for phoenix because our tests will read this file and sometimes even change it which cannot be done if you use env variables or the default values.\nWith all this in place we can just run the tests with a simple make command. First go to the ocis-hello repository\ncd \u0026lt;path to ocis-hello\u0026gt; Then Simply run\nmake test-acceptance-webui To run just one feature you can run\nmake test-acceptance-webui \u0026lt;path-to-feature file\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;line-number\u0026gt; "});index.add({'id':80,'href':'/extensions/settings/values/','title':"Settings Values",'content':"A Settings Value is the value an authenticated user has chosen for a specific setting, defined in a settings bundle. For choosing settings values as a user the sole entry point is the ocis-web extension provided by this service.\nIdentifying settings values A settings value is uniquely identified by four attributes. Three of them are coming from the definition of the setting within it\u0026rsquo;s settings bundle (see Settings Bundles for an example). The fourth identifies the user.\n extension: Key of the extension that registered the settings bundle, bundleKey: Key of the settings bundle, settingKey: Key of the setting as defined within the bundle, accountUuid: The UUID of the authenticated user who has saved the setting.  When requests are going through ocis-proxy, the accountUuid attribute can be set to the static keyword me instead of using a real UUID. ocis-proxy will take care of minting the UUID of the authenticated user into a JWT, providing it in the HTTP header as x-access-token. That UUID is then used in this service, to replace me with the actual UUID of the authenticated user.

However, services can use the respective gRPC endpoints of the ValueService to query and modify settings values as well. The gRPC endpoints require the same identifier attributes as described above, so for making a request to the ValueService you will have to make sure that the accountUuid of the authenticated user is available in your service at the time of the request.\n"});index.add({'id':81,'href':'/ocis/development/tracing/','title':"Tracing",'content':"By default, we use Jaeger for request tracing within oCIS.

Use the Docker host ip 172.17.0.1 or its alias host.docker.internal instead. This requires to adjust all relevant config files to use host.docker.internal instead of localhost (config.json in Phoenix and config/config.php in oC10) and to change the phoenix OIDC-callback url. Set the SERVER_HOST and BACKEND_HOST environment variables accordingly. In order to use the same url for development on the host machine, define it as an alias to 127.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts. After all these changes Phoenix will be accessible at http://host.docker.internal:8300 for both development and acceptance tests.\nSetup using standalone Selenium server When running a standalone Selenium server, make sure to set the environment variable SELENIUM_HOST, SELENIUM_PORT and LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR accordingly.\nrun tests with ownCloud 10 backend  setup the ownCloud 10 backend clone and install testing app into ownCloud build Phoenix start the Phoenix server set SERVER_HOST to point at the URL where the Phoenix web pages are served, for example \u0026ldquo;http://localhost:8300\u0026rdquo; set BACKEND_HOST to point to the URL of the backend, for example \u0026ldquo;http://localhost/owncloud/\u0026rdquo; to be able to run federation tests, additional setup is needed:  Install and setup a second ownCloud server-instance that is accessible by a different URL. That second server-instance must have its own database and data directory. clone and install testing app into the second ownCloud server-instance from http://github.com/owncloud/testing . when running the acceptance tests use REMOTE_BACKEND_HOST environment variable to define its address. for e.g. REMOTE_BACKEND_HOST=http://\u0026lt;ip_address_of_second_ownCloud_server-instance\u0026gt; yarn run acceptance-tests \u0026lt;feature-files-to-test\u0026gt; . -set the SELENIUM_HOST environment variable to your host that runs selenium, mostly localhost -set the SELENIUM_PORT environment variable to your selenium port, mostly 4444    Run yarn run acceptance-tests \u0026lt;feature-files-to-test\u0026gt;.\nThe feature files are located in the \u0026ldquo;tests/acceptance/features\u0026rdquo; subdirectories.\nsee available settings for further setup if needed\nwith OCIS backend  build Phoenix create a new phoenix config.json file and copy it into the dist folder, even running phoenix in the default ocis environment does not need a config.json file, some tests rely on it being present.

We use commit IDs to indicate the version of the backend or testrunner we want to use. These commit IDs should be regularly updated in the .drone.star file to keep the CI up to date. We run phoenix UI tests in following repos in the CI.\n1. phoenix Repo In the owncloud/phoenix repo, we run the tests using both oc10 backend as well as the OCIS backend. For the oc10 backend, we use owncloudci/core docker image which runs the latest daily-master-qa version of owncloud.\nFor the OCIS backend, we use the Commit ID from owncloud/ocis repo to indicate which version of backend to use. This can be specified in the .drone.star file in the config.defaults section.\n\u0026#39;defaults\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;acceptance\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;ocisBranch\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ocisCommit\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;284a9996dffa912cc1382e259b748c56ddc4aa0f\u0026#39;, } }, If the version you want to run is on a different branch from master, you also need to change the branch name.\nIn order to check if new tests are compatible with OCIS, after changing the commit id and the branch name, we can create a draft PR in owncloud/phoenix which triggers the CI and we can see the result there.\n2. ocis Repo We follow the same approach in the owncloud/ocis repo too. In order to run the UI tests in CI we use commit IDs from phoenix which can be changed in the .drone.star file.\nacceptance(ctx, \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;604e8b5e083c835308f147e51a850df643374107\u0026#39;) This is the commit ID of phoenix indicating the version of testrunner we want to use. If the version is on a branch other than master, we will also need to change the branch name.\n"});index.add({'id':84,'href':'/extensions/thumbnails/license/','title':"License",'content':"This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
