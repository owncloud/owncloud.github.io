      <description>Demo driver This is a simple user driver for testing. It contains three users:
einstein:relativity marie:radioactivty richard:superfluidity In order to use the demo driver you need to export the relevant environment variable:
export STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER=demo JSON driver In order to switch from the ldap driver to JSON based users you need to export the relevant environment variables:
export STORAGE_USERS_DRIVER=json export STORAGE_USERS_JSON=/path/to/users.json For the format of the users.json have a look at the reva examples</description>

      <description>Storage commands storage has multiple storage provider commands to preconfigure different default configurations for the reva storage provider service. While you could rerun storage storage-oc multiple times with different flags to get multiple instances we are giving the different commands the necessary default configuration to allow the ocis binary to simply start them and not deal with configuration.
Storage providers To manage the file tree ocis uses storage storage providers that are accessing the underlying storage using a storage driver.</description>

      <description>API Acceptance tests We are using the ownCloud 10 API acceptance testsuite against ocis. To set this up you need the owncloud 10 core repo, a ldap server that the acceptance tests can use to manage users, a redis server for file-versions and the ocis-reva code.
Getting the tests All you need to do to get the acceptance tests is check out the core repo:
git clone https://github.com/owncloud/core.git Run a ldap server in a docker container The ownCloud 10 acceptance tests will need write permission.</description>
