      <description>In order to use the Hello extension we need to configure and start oCIS first. After that we can run the Hello extension itself.
Configure and start oCIS    You can either start oCIS from a binary or build it from source.
No matter which way you choose, we need to create a configuration file for ownCloud Web, so that the Hello extension will be loaded in the frontend.</description>

      <description>oCIS provides an settings extension that other extensions can use to make settings accessible to users.
In case of the Hello extension administrator users are able to change the greeter message.
Settings are stored and presented to the user by the oCIS settings extension. It also exposes endpoints for registering and manipulating so called settings bundles.
The settings defined through settings bundles can be changed by authenticated users in ownCloud Web, if they have enough permissions to edit them.</description>

      <description>This repository provides a general guideline for creating tests for an oCIS extension. The tests can be written in various levels from unit, integration, and end-to-end. It is not essential to write tests on all these levels as it can be redundant in some cases. This repository provides a reference for all levels of tests.
Unit tests    Unit tests generally live inside *_test.go files in the /pkg directory.</description>
