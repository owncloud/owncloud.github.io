      <title>Storage Registry Discovery</title>

      <description>Introduction    In order for an oCIS client to access oCIS storage spaces for an End-User, the client needs to know where the oCIS instance is. oCIS uses WebFinger RFC7033 to locate the oCIS instance for an End-User.
This discovery is optional. If the client has another way of discovering the OpenID instance, e.g. when logging in with a username a static domain might be configured or the domain in the URL might be used.</description>

      <title>Migration</title>

      <description>The migration happens in subsequent stages while the service is online. First all users need to migrate to the new architecture, then the global namespace needs to be introduced. Finally, the data on disk can be migrated user by user by switching the storage driver.
@jfd: It might be easier to introduce the spaces api in oc10 and then migrate to oCIS. We cannot migrate both at the same time, the architecture to oCIS (which will change fileids) and introduce a global namespace (which requires stable fileids to let clients handle moves without redownloading).</description>

      <description>Metrics    This service provides some Prometheus metrics through the debug endpoint, you can optionally secure the metrics endpoint by some random token, which has to be configured either through the flag --debug-token or the environment variable OCIS_DEBUG_TOKEN mentioned above. By default, the metrics endpoint is bound to http://0.0.0.0:8001/metrics.

      <description>You may have asked yourself why there are major version 1 tags in our GitHub repository but the Readme still states ownCloud Infinite Scale is currently in a technical preview state. It will be subject to a lot of changes and is not yet ready for general production deployments.. How can that be if its a major version 1?
Our initial and also our current plan is to stick to SemVer as versioning scheme.</description>
